# What are Stationary Waves?  
  
Stationary waves are produced by the [[../To do/Superposition|Superposition]] of two waves of the same [[./Frequency|Frequency]] and [[./Amplitude|Amplitude]] travelling in *opposite directions*. This is usually achieved by a [[./Progressive Waves|Progressive Wave]] and its [[../To do/Reflection|Reflection]].   
  
  
## Key info  
  
This [[../To do/Superposition|superposition]] produced a wave pattern where the peaks and troughs of the wave *DO NOT* oscillate.  Stationary waves store energy, unlike [[./Progressive Waves|Progressive Wave]] which transfer energy.   
  
# Nodes and Anti-Nodes  
An anti-node is a point of maximum oscillation along a stationary wave in [[../To do/Superposition|superposition]]. Whereas the node is a point of no oscillation.  
  
Points that have an *odd* number of nodes between them are considered *out of phase*. Whereas points that have an *even* number of nodes between them are considered in phase.

Stationary waves, also known as standing waves, are a type of wave phenomenon where the wave appears to be stationary, not traveling along the medium. They are formed by the interference of two waves traveling in opposite directions.  
  
**Formation:**  
  
*   **Superposition:**  A stationary wave is created when two waves with the same frequency, wavelength, and amplitude travel in opposite directions through the same medium.  
*   **Reflection:**  One common method is when a wave is reflected back upon itself.  The incident wave and the reflected wave interfere.  
  
**Characteristics:**  
  
*   **Nodes:** Points along the wave where the amplitude is *always* zero.  These points represent destructive interference.  The displacement at a node is always zero.  
*   **Antinodes:** Points along the wave where the amplitude is *maximum*.  These points represent constructive interference.  The displacement at an antinode varies maximally with time.  
*   **Wavelength (λ):** The distance between two successive nodes or two successive antinodes is half a wavelength (λ/2).  Therefore, the full wavelength is twice the distance between adjacent nodes or antinodes.  
*   **Frequency (f):**  The frequency of the stationary wave is the same as the frequency of the two original traveling waves that created it.  
*   **Energy:** Unlike traveling waves, stationary waves do not transfer energy. Energy is trapped within the wave, oscillating between kinetic and potential energy.  However, energy is still *dissipated* through damping mechanisms.  
  
**Examples:**  
  
*   **Musical Instruments:** Stringed instruments (e.g., guitars, pianos) and wind instruments (e.g., flutes, trumpets) rely on stationary waves to produce sound. Different harmonics (overtones) are created by different stationary wave patterns.  
*   **Microwave Ovens:** Microwave ovens use stationary waves of microwaves to heat food. The antinodes are where the heating is most intense.  The rotating plate helps ensure more even heating.  
*   **Acoustics:** Room acoustics are affected by the formation of stationary waves, which can lead to areas of amplified or reduced sound. This is especially important in recording studios and concert halls.  
*   **Optical Cavities:** Lasers often use optical cavities (mirrors facing each other) to create stationary waves of light, which are then amplified.  
  
**Mathematical Representation:**  
  
The equation for a stationary wave can be expressed as:  
  
`y(x, t) = 2A cos(kx) sin(ωt)`  
  
Where:  
  
*   `y(x, t)` is the displacement at position `x` and time `t`.  
*   `A` is the amplitude of the original traveling waves.  
*   `k` is the wave number (`k = 2π/λ`).  
*   `ω` is the angular frequency (`ω = 2πf`).  
*   `x` is the position along the wave.  
*   `t` is the time.  
  
This equation shows that the amplitude of the wave varies with position `x` due to the `cos(kx)` term, creating the nodes and antinodes. The `sin(ωt)` term describes the oscillation of the wave at each point.  
  
**Harmonics/Overtones:**  
  
Stationary waves can exist in various patterns called harmonics or overtones. The fundamental frequency (first harmonic) is the lowest frequency at which a stationary wave can form.  Higher harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency. The specific frequencies that can be produced depend on the boundary conditions (e.g., fixed ends of a string).
