# Revision [[./Stationary Waves|Stationary Waves]]  
04.1. minima and maxima are formed when the waves bounce back from the metal plate and intefere with the wave coming into the plate  
maxima are where a peak collides with another peak to amplify the peak  
minima are where a peak collids with a trough, cancelling each other out to create a stationary point  
  
04.2. 5 minima equal 2 waves  
54mm/2=27mm  
27mm=0.0027m  
w/l=0.0027  
  
  
04.3. $(3\times10^8)/0.0027=11.1GHz$
