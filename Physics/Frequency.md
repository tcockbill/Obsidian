# What is Frequency?  
Frequency is denoted as being the amount of times that an even occurs over a time [[../To do/Period|period]], this could be crests in a wave, or heartbeats per minute. The main element in defining frequency is that it occurs *over time*, giving it the SI base units of $s^{-1}$.   
  
# SI base units  
The *SI* base units of frequency are $s^{-1}$ , and is referred to as $Hz$, pronounced "Hertz".   
  
# Some equations its used in  
  
$$c =  f \lambda$$  
$$f = \frac{1}{2L} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
