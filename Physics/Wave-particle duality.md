## <u>Starter questions</u>  
1. [[../To do/Gravity|Gravity]] and air resistance will be equal as he is travelling at his terminal velocity  
2. Current  
3. $3.12 ms^{-2}$  
4. $kgm^2s^{-3}A^{-2}$  
5. $E_k=eV$  
$E_k = (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \space C) \times (7800\space V)$  
$E_k=1.24956 \times 10^{-15}\space J$  
$E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$  
$v^2 = \frac{2 \times 1.24956 \times 10^{-15} \space J}{9.109 \times 10^{-31} \space kg}$  
$v \approx 1.656 \times 10^7 \space ms^{-1}$  
  
## <u>Light as wave</u>  
Light as a wave diffracts, reflects and refracts  
  
## <u>The particulate nature of light</u>  
- The photoelectric effect and the absorption of specific energies of light by atoms shows that energy is quantized in light  
- Quantized light packets are called photons and behave like particles  
  
## <u>Wave-particle duality</u>  
- Electromagnetic radiation travels as a wave and interacts as a particle.  
- This is reality and is difficult (if impossible) to truly understand as a model  
  
- Electrons are particles however, when they are passed at high speed through a small gap they create a diffraction pattern on the other side  
- This diffraction pattern can only be created by something that is travelling as a wave  
  
## <u>De Broglie waves</u>  
in 1923 Louis de Broglie hypothesized that if a particle travelled as a wave with sufficiently long wavelengths, then wave-like properties would become visible. To have long De Broglie waves, a particle needs to be very small (electrons) going relatively slowly  
$$\lambda_{DB} = \frac{h}{\rho} = \frac{h}{mv}$$  
$$\text{The time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation is given by } i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) + V(\mathbf{r}) \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$$
