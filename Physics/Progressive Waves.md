# What are Progressive Waves?  
  
## Properties of Oscillations  
  
A progressive wave is defined as: *A wave that transfers energy from one point to another without transferring the medium itself.*   
  
## Properties of a Progressive Wave  
  
- [[../To do/Displacement|Displacement]] ($x$) of a wave is the distance from a point on a wave from its equilibrium position. [[../To do/Displacement|Displacement]] is a vector quantity; it can be positive or negative.   
- [[./Amplitude|Amplitude]] ($A$) is the maximum [[../To do/Displacement|displacement]] of a particle in the wave from its equilibrium position.  
- [[./Wavelength|Wavelength]] ($\lambda$) is the distance between points on successive oscillations of the wave that are in phase:  Measured in *metres* ($m$).  
  
- [[../To do/Period|Period]] ($t$) or time [[../To do/Period|period]], is the time taken for one complete oscillation or cycle of the wave, measured in *seconds*.  
  
- [[./Frequency|Frequency]] ($f$) is the number of complete oscillations per unit time. Measured in $Hz$ or $s^{-1}$.   
- [[../To do/Speed|Speed]] ($v$) is the distance travelled by the wave per unit time. Measured in $m \, s^{-1}$ or metres per second.   
  
  
## Equations  
  
The wave equation $v = f \, \lambda$  links *[[../To do/Speed|speed]], [[./Frequency|frequency]] and [[./Wavelength|wavelength]]* of a wave. This is relevant for both [[./Transverse and Longitudinal Waves|Transverse and Longitudinal Waves]].   
  
### Breakdown of the wave equation  
  
The wave equation shows that for a wave of constant speed:   
- As the [[./Wavelength|wavelength]] *increases*, the [[./Frequency|frequency]] *decreases*.   
- As the [[./Wavelength|wavelength]] *decreases*, the [[./Frequency|frequency]] *increases*.  
  
$v = f \, \lambda \implies \lambda = \frac{v}{f}$  
  
  
**THIS IS KNOWN AS AN INVERSE PROPORTIONALITY AS IT MATCHES THE FORMAT $y=\frac{k}{x}$**  
  
  
## Exam Tips  
  
You may see the wave equation be written as $c = f \lambda$ where c is the wave [[../To do/Speed|speed]]. However this can be a problematic as $c$ is often used to denote the [[./Speed of Light|Speed of Light]], or [[./Speed of Light|Speed of Causality]], ($3 \times 10^{8}$).
