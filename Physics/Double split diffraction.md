# Starter questions  
1. Pair production is when a photon has enough energy and forms a pair of a particle and its antiparticle  
2. [[./Frequency|Frequency]] = $\frac{1}{time \space period}$  
3. $\sin \theta = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$  
4. $n=\frac{c}{c_s}$  
5. angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle - must be going from a more refractive substance to a less refractive substance  
  
# [[./Young's Double slit interference|Young's double slit]]  
In 1801, an English physicist named **Thomas Young** performed an experiment an experiment that strongly inferred the wave-like nature of light.  
  
## Formula  
$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$  
$Fringe \space spacing = \frac{wavelength \space \times \space distance}{slit \space seperation}$  
Constructive interface path difference = $n \lambda$  
Destructive interference path difference =$\frac{n}{2} \lambda$  
  
## Mathematical derivation  
  
## Applying the equation  
1. $\frac{(5.9 \times 10^{-7}) \times 0.8}{?}=0.0048$  
$\frac{(5.9 \times 10^{-7}) \times 0.8}{0.0048}=? \qquad ?=98.3 \mu m$  
2. $\frac{(6 \times 10^{-7}) \times 1.8}{0.0001} = ? \qquad 1.08 \times 10^{-3}$  
3.
