# What is it?   
  
Harmonic frequencies are frequencies of a wave that when reflected, oscillate at the perfect [[./Frequency|frequency]] to cancel each other out. This cancellation forms Nodes and Anti node; with nodes being points with minimum oscillation. Harmonics are also a form of [[./Stationary Waves|Stationary Wave]].   
  
# How can this be found?   
*The [[./Frequency|frequency]] of the nth harmonic is equal to n over twice the length of the string, multiplied by the square root of [[./Tension|tension]] of the string; over its [[../To do/Mass|mass]] per square unit.*  
  
$$  
f_n = \frac{n}{2L} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}  
$$
