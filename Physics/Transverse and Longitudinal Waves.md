# What are Transverse and Longitudinal Waves?  
  
There are two types of wave: *transverse and longitudinal*. Transverse waves oscillate perpendicular to the direction of energy propagation; whereas longitudinal waves oscillate parallel to energy propagation. In mechanical waves, particles oscillate about fixed points. The type of wave can be determined by the direction of the oscillations in relation to the direction the wave is travelling.   
  
# Transverse Waves  
  
A transverse wave is defined as:   
- A wave in which the particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer / propagation.  
Transverse waves show areas of crests and troughs.   
  
Some examples of Transverse Waves include:  
- [[../To do/Electromagnetic Waves|Electromagnetic Waves]]   
- Seismic S  
  
These waves can be demonstrated on a rope; in addition to being able to be *polarised*.  
  
# Longitudinal Waves  
  
Longitudinal waves show areas of compressions and rarefactions.  
- *Compressions* are areas of increased pressure  
- *Rarefactions* are areas of decreased pressure  
  
Examples of longitudinal waves are:  
- Sound waves   
- Ultrasound waves  
- Seismic P  
  
These waves can be showcased on a slinky spring. They *CANNOT* be polarised. Energy is transmitted through the wave by the mediating particles vibrating as they are given energy; the compressions cause the nearby particles to also vibrate with more energy, leading to a compression further along the medium.
