# Starter  
1. 26.1°  
2. The width of the slit is the same as the wavelength  
  
# Radians  
Measuring angles in degrees becomes less useful in advanced maths and physics, because they are arbitrary.  
Radians are used because they are multiples of pi, which is the natural unit for trigonometric functions  
  
A radian is defined as the angle in the segment of a circle where every side in length r  
  
## Conversions  
  
| Degrees | Radians |  
| ------- | ------- |  
| 45      | π/4     |  
| 90      | π/2     |  
| 180     | π       |  
| 360     | 2π      |

From degrees to radians: multiply by 2π/360

From radians to degrees: multiply by 360/2π
