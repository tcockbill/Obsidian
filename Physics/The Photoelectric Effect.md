# The Photoelectric Effect  
## Monday, February 24th, 2025  
### Starter  
1. $\bar{u} \thinspace \bar{u} \thinspace \bar{d}$  
2. $E=hc/\lambda$  
$E=\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10 ^{8}}{1.6 \times 10 ^{-14}}=1.24 \times 10 ^{-11}\thinspace J$  
  
## Definition  
When photons of electromagnetic [[./Radiation|radiation]] are incident on a metal surface, they may liberate electrons   
  
  
## Photons as particles  
If you consider photons to be particulate in nature when they collide with the metal, then you can say:  
1. One photon hits one [[./Electron|electron]] and gives all of its energy to that single [[./Electron|electron]]  
2. The [[./Electron|electron]] will leave the metal surface only is the energy it is given is above a certain value called the **work function**, which is specific to the metal used  
3. If the [[./Electron|electron]] does not elave then it loses the energy to surrounding electrons rapidly (which slowly heats the metal)  
  
## Kinetic energy of an [[./Electron|electron]]  
The energy from the photon is given to the [[./Electron|electron]] in the metal. Some of this is then used to escape the metal, and the remainder is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron.  
$$ E_{K\thinspace(max)} = hf - \varnothing $$  
  
## Threshold [[./Frequency|Frequency]]  
- You can equate the formula and make the kinetic energy zero (i.e. the [[./Electron|electron]] can only just leave the surface of the metal) and rearrange to give the formula:  
 $$ f_{min} = \frac{\varnothing}{h}$$  
  
# Application of the Photoelectric Effect  
## Tuesday, February 25th, 2025  
### Starter Questions  
1. Increase the [[./Wavelength|wavelength]]  
2. $5.55 \times 10 ^{14} \thinspace Hz$  
3. insert feynman diagram here  
4. No, the [[../To do/Lepton|lepton]] number is not conserved  
  
## Describe the photoelectric effect in your own words  
Photons are fired at a metal in a light ray. If the energy of the photon is greater than the work function ffor the metal, the energy from the photons liberates electrons from the sea of delocalised electrons in the metallic lattice of the metal, and excess energy can be transferred to the kinetic energy store of the [[./Electron|electron]].  
  
## Stopping potential (difference) $V_s$  
The potential difference needed to stop the electrons escaping the metal by the photoelectric effect.  
At this potential, the maximum kinetic energy is reduced to zero, hence it's maximum kinetic energy is equal to $e \times V_s$  
  
$$ V_s= \frac{E}{q}$$  
$$ E=qV_s$$
