# Stress and strain  
  
## Tensile stress  
If I load a wire with weights, the stress on the wire is the force per unit area that a material is subjected to.  
$Nm^{-2} \qquad 1Pa=1nM^{-2}$  
>[!formula] Formula for stress:  
>$$\sigma = \frac{T}{A} = \frac{F}{A}$$  
  
## Tensile strain  
If I load a wire with weights, it will get longer and thinner. It is the ratio of the extension or elongation to the original length.  
>[!formula] Formula for strain  
>$$\epsilon = \frac{e}{L} =\frac{\Delta L}{L}$$

P = Limit of proportionality  
E= Elastic limit  
Y$_1$ = Yield point where it is weakened temporarily  
Y$_2$ = Yield point beyond which it is permanently weakend  
UTS = Ultimate tensile strength - loses strength and thins (necking) causing stress to increase  
Failure = Catastrophic failure of bonds at one place  
  
The Young Modulus or "E" or YM is simply the ratio of stress to strain.  
>[!formula] The formula for Youngs Modulus:  
>$$ \frac{\sigma}{\upsilon} = \frac{\frac{F}{A}}{\frac{e}{L}} = \frac{FL}{Ae} = YM$$  
  
## Questions  
>[!exam-question] YM Maths Exam Question (4 marks)  
>A wire length 2m and diameter 0.4mm is hung from the ceiling. Find the extension caused in the wire when a weight of 100N is hung on it. The Youngs Modulus for the wire is $2 \times 10^{11} \thinspace Pa$.

>$\frac{FL}{AE} = e$  
>$\frac{100 \times 2}{1.257 \times 10^{-7} \times 2 \times 10^{11}} = e$  
>$e=7.95 \times 10^{-3}m = 0.8mm$
