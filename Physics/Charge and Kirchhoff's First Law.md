# Notes  
[[../To do/Charge|Charge]] is the amount of current through a circuit in a unit of time meaused in Coulombs $(C)$  
Current is the rate of flow of [[../To do/Charge|charge]] or flow of electrons meaused in amps $(A)$  
$Q=IT$  
$C=As$  
  
A parallel circuit has junctions, a series one does not   
  
Series - Current is always the same  
-> more components in series = less current  
  
# Kirchhoff's First law  
The algebraic sum of the currents through a junction is zero. Currents approaching the junction are positive, while currents going away from the junction are negative
