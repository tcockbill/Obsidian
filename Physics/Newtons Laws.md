# Law 1  
Newtons first law, often referred to as the law of [[../To do/Inertia|inertia]], states that every object that is not being acted upon by an external resultant force continues moving at a constant velocity; be it at rest or in motion.  Resultant force $= 0$.   
  
# Law 2  
The second of Newton's laws states that the force acting on an object is directly proportional to the [[../To do/Mass|mass]] of the object, and the [[./Acceleration|acceleration]]. This law provides the basis for the equation, $$f = ma$$  
This equation can also be used to define the force of weight that objects on earth experience; as we know $g \approx 9.81 m \, s^{-1}$   
# Law 3  
  
Every reaction has an equal and opposite reaction. See [[./Reaction Force|reaction force]]
