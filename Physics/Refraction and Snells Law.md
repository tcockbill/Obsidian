# Starter  
1. $f=\frac{1}{T}\therefore{f}=\frac{1}{1.2\times10^{-2}}=83Hz$  
2. A wave where the direction of oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer  
3. The change in [[../To do/Speed|speed]] and direction between media due to the differing optical densities  
4. 9000/0.3=  
5. 2 protons + 2 neutrons  
  
# Notes   
When [[./Refraction|refraction]] occurs, if the light is slowing down, it bends toward the normal, and when the light is speeding up, it bends away from the normal  
  
[[../To do/Refractive index|Refractive index]] - the [[../To do/Refractive index|refractive index]], n, of a substance is defined as the ratio of the velocity of light in a vacuum, [[./Speed of Light|c]], to its velocity in a substance, C$_s$  
  
If an object has a [[../To do/Refractive index|refractive index]] of n=2.419, what is the [[./Speed of Light|speed of light]] in the object  
  
(3* 10^8)/2.419=  
=$1.2\times10^8$  
  
[[../To do/Snell's law|Snell's law]] - the general version of [[../To do/Snell's law|Snell's law]] states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence, $\theta_1$, and [[./Refraction|refraction]], $\theta_2$, is equivalent to the ratio of velocities in the two media.  
$$n_1\sin\theta_1=n_2\sin\theta_2$$  
which can be rearranged to   
$$\frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2}=\frac{v_1}{v_2}=\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
