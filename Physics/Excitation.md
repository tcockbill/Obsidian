# <u><b>Excitation and Ionisation</b></u>  
## <u>Bohr's Atom</u>  
<span style="color: #0000F4; background-color: rgba(253,253,150,0.6);">Electrons can only have certain values of energy.</span>  
Their energy os discrete, not continuous  
  
## <u>Energy levels in atoms</u>  
The electrons will naturally fill the shells from the lowest energy first, called the <b>ground state</b>.  
When a photon is absorbed by an [[./Electron|electron]], we say it becomes <b>excited</b> to a <b>higher energy level</b>.  
  
## <u>Excitation by collision</u>  
A charged particle can collide with an orbital [[./Electron|electron]] and give it enough energy to reach an excited state.  
<b>The [[./Electron|electron]] will fall back to its stable state, releasign a photon of specific [[./Frequency|frequency]]</b>

## <u>Fluorescent tubes</u>  
- A large voltage across a tube ionizes the gas inside (usually a low [[./Density|Density]] mercury vapour)  
- A constant current then flows through it, exciting electrons in the gas atoms  
- These electrons de-excite and produce photons in the UV spectrum  
- The inside of the glass contains a powder that absorbs the UV photons and de-excites to emit visible light photons  
  
## <u>Photomultiplier tube</u>  
A photomultiplier tube consists of a vacuum chamber with a photocathode at one end and an anode at the other. Between these two electrodes lie a focussing electrode and a series of small curved electrodes known as dynodes. The dynodes are set at increasing positive potentials with a potential difference (PD) of around 100V between each. The PDS cause electrons to be accelerated from the direction of the photocathode towards the anode.  
  
- A photon strikes the photocathode, producing a single [[./Electron|electron]] through [[./The Photoelectric Effect|the photoelectric effect]]. This first [[./Electron|electron]] is known as the primary [[./Electron|electron]].  
- The primary [[./Electron|electron]] passes through a focussing electrode which directs it towards the first dynode.  
- The first dynode is at a higher positive PD than the photocathode, and so the primary [[./Electron|electron]] is accelerated towards it.  
- The primary [[./Electron|electron]] strikes the dynode and causes the emission of several electrons through a process of secondary emission. (The primary [[./Electron|electron]] is absorbed by the material and provides energy to release a burst of secondary electrons.)  
- The secondary electrons are accelerated towards the secondary dynode where each of the electrons strikes the surface, are absorbed, and further emissions of secondary electrons which accelerate towards the next dynode.  
- After several stages, the initial single [[./Electron|electron]] has been 'multiplied' hundreds of thousands of times to give a surge of electrons which reach the cathode.  
- The time taken between the primary [[./Electron|electron]] being produced and the secondary [[./Electron|electron]] pulse reaching the anode is easy to calculate, and so the exact time that the photon was produced can be measured precisely.
