# Questions  
1. The water droplet refracts the white light and due to different wave lengths refracting more or less, the light is visible as different colours, creating a rainbow.  
2. Light is scattered by molecules of gas  
3. Shorter wavelengths are scattered most strongly  
4. There is not much violet in sunlight as it is, and our eyes are more sensitive to blue light  
5. The light further away from us has been scattered more strongly, so there is a higher percentage of white light in the light we see coming from the horizon  
6. A [[./Circumzenithal Arc|circumzenithal arc]] is a rainbow, but directly overhead, caused by light entering ice crystals in cirrus clouds and refracting.  
  
# Total internal [[../To do/Reflection|reflection]]  
Total internal refelction is when light reaches a boundary where $n_1>n_2$, the light ray will refract away from the normal, the angle of [[./Refraction|refraction]] will eventually approach 90$\textdegree$   
  
Critical angle $\theta_1$ of any substance can be found using: $\sin\theta_c=\frac{n_2}{n_1}$  
  
When the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, the light does not refract out of the medium. Instead all of the light is reflected back into the original medium.  
  
# More questions  
1. the critical angle is the angle of incidence at which all light is reflected back inside the object  
2. The first [[../To do/Refractive index|refractive index]] is higher than the second, and the angle of incidence is higher than the critical angle  
3. C  
4. ri of 0.99$\space$ $\frac{0.99}{1.38}=0.717391$ $\space$ $\sin^{-1}(0.7173913403)=45.84\textdegree$ critical angle  
5. The light enters the glass prism parallel to the normal/perpendicular to the surface  
	1. critical angle is 41.81
