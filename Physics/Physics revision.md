# Exam style questions  
06.1. a [[./Stationary Waves|stationary wave]] on a guitar string is formed when the length of the string exactly matches the length of the first harmonic  
  
06.2. w/l = 1.24 m  [[./Frequency|frequency]] = 82 Hz   $1.24 \times 82 = 101.68ms^{-1}$   
  
06.3 $\frac{0.62}{2} = 0.31m$    w/l = $0.31 \times 2 = 0.62$   $101.68 = 0.62 \times ?$    $? = 164Hz$   
  
06.4   
  
1.  a. the [[./Amplitude|amplitude]] of a wave is the distance between the peak of a wave and the x axis  
    b. i. Vibrations in a guitar strings   
     ii. transverse, oscillation is perpendicular to energy transfer, longitudinal, oscillation is parallel to the direction of energy transfer
