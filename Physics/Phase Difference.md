# What is Phase Difference?  
  
The phase difference between two waves is a measure of *how much a point or wave is in front or behind another*. This can be found from the relative positive of the crests or troughs of two different waves of the same [[./Frequency|frequency]].   
- When the crests or troughs are aligned, the waves are *in phase*  
- When the crest of one wave aligns with the trough of another, they are in *antiphase*.   
  
Phase difference is measured in *fractions of [[./Wavelength|Wavelength]], [[../To do/Degrees|Degrees]] or [[../To do/Radians|Radians]]*. The phase difference can be calculated from two different points on the same wave or the same point on two different waves.   
  
The phase difference between two points can be described as:   
- *In phase* is $360 \deg$ or $2 \pi$ [[../To do/Radians|radians]].  
- *In anti-phase* is $180 \deg$ or $\pi$ [[../To do/Radians|radians]].
