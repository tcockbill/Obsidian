# What is Particle Physics?  
  
All physical matter in the universe is affected by 4 [[./Fundamental Forces|Fundamental forces]] that dictate all particle interactions in the universe. These [[./Fundamental Forces|fundamental forces]] consist of:   
  
- Nuclear Weak  
- Nuclear Strong  
- Electromagnetic  
- [[../To do/Gravity|Gravity]]  
  
Each force has its own range, and different properties; as well as having a respective [[../To do/Exchange Particle|exchange particle]], that transfers the force between constituent elements of the reaction.  
  
These particles are as follows:   
  
- Force, Weak, $W, Z$ boson  
 - Electromagnetic $\gamma$, virtual photon  
 - [[../To do/Gravity|Gravity]], $g$ graviton

Particle physics also dictates the interactions between particles inside radioactivity interactions, and standard [[./Radiation|radiation]] decay in most particles. See [[./Radiation|Radiation]]
