# Equations  
$$P = \frac{wd}{T}$$  
$$P=IV$$  
$$P=I^2R$$  
$$P=\frac{V^2}{R}$$  
  
Power in circuits refers to the amount of energy that is used or transferred in an electrical circuit over time. It is a measure of how quickly electrical energy is converted into other forms of energy, such as heat, light, or motion.   
  
In simple terms, power can be thought of as the “work” done by electricity. The formula to calculate power (P) in a circuit is given by:  
  
$$ P = V \times I $$  
  
Where $V$ is the voltage (the electrical pressure) and $I$ is the current (the flow of electric [[../To do/Charge|charge]]).   
  
Higher voltage or higher current means more power is being used. Understanding power helps in designing circuits that can handle the required energy without overheating or failing.
