# [[./Polarisation|Polarisation]]  
Transversed waves are **plane-polarised** if the vibrations stay in one plane only. If the vibrations change from one plane to another, then the waves are unpolarised. Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised.  
  
If unpolarised light is pass through two polarising filters at right angles to each other, little to no waves of light get through.  
  
• 	 The **[[../To do/Displacement|displacement]]** of a vibrating particle is its distance and  direction from its equilibrium position.   
• 	 The **[[./Amplitude|amplitude]]** of a wave is the maximum [[../To do/Displacement|displacement]] of a  vibrating particle. For a transverse wave, this is the height of a wave  crest or the depth of a wave trough rrom its equilibrium position.   
• 	 The **[[./Wavelength|wavelength]]** of a wave is the least distance between two  adjacent vibrating particles with the same [[../To do/Displacement|displacement]] and  velocity at the same time (e.g., distance between adjacent crests).   
• 	 One **complete** cycle of a wave is from maximum [[../To do/Displacement|displacement]]  to the next maximum [[../To do/Displacement|displacement]] (e.g., from one wave peak to  the next).   
• 	 The **[[../To do/Period|period]]** of a wave is the time for one complete wave to pass  a fixed point.   
• 	 The **[[./Frequency|frequency]]** of a wave is the number of cycles of vibration of  a particle per second, or the number of complete waves passing a  point per second. The unit of [[./Frequency|frequency]] is the hertz (Hz).
