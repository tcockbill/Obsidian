# Newtons law of [[../Gravitation|Gravitation]]  
$F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$ - this is the force between 2 masses  
Gravitational field strength is $g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$   
These two relate where $mg=F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$  
The two $m$s cancel each other out to form the eqation  
$g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$  
  
$GPE=mgh$ and $F=mg$ are for use in a uniform field, whereas $F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$ and $g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$ are used for a radial field  
## Gravitational Fields  
  
### Definition  
  
A gravitational field is a region of space surrounding a mass where another mass will experience a force of attraction. It's a vector field, meaning it has both magnitude and direction at every point in space.  We can think of it as the "influence" a mass exerts on its surroundings.  
  
### Field Strength  
  
* **Definition:** The gravitational field strength, denoted by 'g', is the force per unit mass experienced by a small test mass placed in the field.  
  
* **Equation:**  `g = F/m` where:  
    * `g` is the gravitational field strength (N/kg or m/s²)  
    * `F` is the gravitational force (N)  
    * `m` is the mass of the test object (kg)  
  
* **Radial Fields:** Around a spherically symmetric object (e.g., a planet), the field is radial. The field lines point directly inwards towards the center of the mass.  
  
### Calculating Gravitational Field Strength  
  
* **Near a Point Mass:** The gravitational field strength at a distance 'r' from a point mass 'M' is given by:  
  
    `g = GM/r²` where:  
    * `G` is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N⋅m²/kg²)  
    * `M` is the mass creating the field (kg)  
    * `r` is the distance from the center of the mass (m)  
  
### [[./Gravitational potential|Gravitational Potential]]  
  
* **Definition:** [[./Gravitational potential|Gravitational potential]] (V) at a point is the work done per unit mass in bringing a small test mass from infinity to that point.  
  
* **Equation (for a point mass):** `V = -GM/r`  
  
    * Note the negative sign:  Work is done *by* the field to bring the test mass in from infinity, so the potential decreases as you get closer to the mass.  
  
* **Relationship to Field Strength:** The gravitational field strength is the negative gradient of the [[./Gravitational potential|gravitational potential]].  In simpler terms, it's how quickly the potential changes with distance. `g = -dV/dr`  
  
### Equipotential Surfaces  
  
* Surfaces where the [[./Gravitational potential|gravitational potential]] is constant.  
  
* No work is done to move a mass along an equipotential surface.  
  
* Field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces.  
  
### [[./Gravitational potential|Gravitational Potential Energy]]  
  
* **Definition:** The potential energy (U) of a mass 'm' in a gravitational field is the work done to move that mass from infinity to its current position.  
  
* **Equation:** `U = mV = -GMm/r`  (where 'M' is the mass creating the field)  
  
* **Change in Potential Energy:** The change in potential energy when moving a mass between two points in a gravitational field is `ΔU = mΔV`.  
  
### Importance & Applications  
  
* **Orbital Mechanics:** Understanding gravitational fields is crucial for calculating orbits of planets, satellites, and spacecraft.  
  
* **Astrophysics:**  Essential for modeling the behavior of stars, galaxies, and black holes.  
  
* **Geophysics:**  Used in studying the Earth's [[../To do/Gravity|gravity]] field for resource exploration and geodesy.  
  
### Key Concepts to Remember  
  
* Gravitational fields are attractive.  
* Field strength is a vector quantity.  
* Potential is a scalar quantity.  
* The further you are from a mass, the weaker the gravitational field and the less negative the [[./Gravitational potential|gravitational potential]].
