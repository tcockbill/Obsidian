# What is Radiation ?  
  
There are many types of radiation; $\beta ^{+}, \, \beta ^ {+}, \, \alpha, \, \gamma$. Beta, Alpha, Gamma respectively. Each one has it sown unique traits and properties that dictate the way in which they interact.  
  
For instance:  
  
# [[../To do/Beta Decay|Beta Decay]]  
  
[[../To do/Beta Decay|Beta Decay]] comes in two forms; beta- decay, and beta+ decay. Each one creates a respective $\beta$ particle of its respective [[../To do/Charge|charge]], with the $\beta$ being an [[./Electron|Electron]]. Thus it can be concluded that beta - decay releases a standard [[./Electron|electron]]. This is then counteracted by the anti-[[../To do/Lepton|lepton]] $\bar v _{e}$.  This is because [[../To do/Lepton|lepton]] Number **MUST** be conserved.

$$
