# What is Polarisation?  
  
Polarisation is when particle oscillations occur in only one of the directions perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.   
Polarisation can *only* occur in [[./Transverse and Longitudinal Waves|Transverse]] waves, this is because transverse waves oscillate in any plane perpendicular to the propagation direction.  
  
When [[./Transverse and Longitudinal Waves|Transverse Waves]] are polarised, this means:  
- Vibrations are restricted to one direction  
- These vibrations are still perpendicular to the direction of propagation, and thus still transverse.  
  
Only waves that align with the transmission axis will be allowed through the polarising filter. This shows that only non polarised waves can be polarised.  
  
# Additional Info  
  
Light can also be polarised through [[../To do/Reflection|Reflection]], [[./Refraction|Refraction]] and [[../To do/Scattering|Scattering]].
