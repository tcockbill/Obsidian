# What is thrust?  
  
Thrust is a force that is characterised by its upwards movement, it is commonly found in rockets in transit, as the [[./Reaction Force|reaction force]] to the expulsion of gas from its engines. Another common example of thrust is "[[../To do/Upthrust|upthrust]]" which arises as a result of buoyancy.
