# Circumzenithal Arc  
A circumzenithal arc is a captivating atmospheric phenomenon. It's an optical illusion that appears as a bright, colorful arc in the sky, similar to a rainbow but occurring at the zenith (directly overhead). These arcs form when sunlight enters ice crystals in cirrus clouds at just the right angle, creating a spectrum of colors due to the [[./Refraction|refraction]] of light.  
  
These arcs are sometimes called "upside-down rainbows" because of their curved shape and vivid colors. They are most visible when the sun is low in the sky, and their beauty often surprises those fortunate enough to witness them.
