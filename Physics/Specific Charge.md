# What is Specific [[../To do/Charge|Charge]]?  
  
Specific [[../To do/Charge|charge]] is a measure of [[../To do/Charge|charge]] per [[../To do/Mass|unit of mass]] of an object. Commonly referred to as *Coulombs per Kilogram*. It can be calculated using this equation: $S_{q} = \frac{Q}{K_{g}}$ and has *SI* base units, $c \, k_{g}^{-1}$.
