# Aldehydes and ketones  
  
## Information  
Aldehydes and ketones are known as carbonyls  
Aldehydes have the functional group $CHO$  
Ketones have the functional group $CCOC$  
  
## Physical properties  
1. Boiling point higher than hydrocarbons with a similar $m_r$ due to stronger dipole-dipole forces in carbonyls  
2. Boiling point lower than acids/alcohols of similar $m_r$ due to no hydrogen bonding in carbonyls  
3. Provided the $m_r$ is not too large, carbonyls are soluble due to the oxygen atoms hydrogen bonding with the hydrogen atoms in water  
  
## Preparing aldehydes  
Aldehydes are the first oxidation product of primary alcohols.  
  
```smiles  
[R]C([H])([H])O([H]).[O]>>[R]C([H])=O.[H]O[H]  
```  
The oxidising agent is provided by acidified   
The product is immediately distilled to prevent further oxidation  
  
## Preparing ketones  
Ketones are the oxidation product of secondary alcohols  
The oxidising agent is provided by acidified $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$  
  
## Detecting and identifying aldehydes and ketones  
Unknown organic compound -> +2,4 DNP -> orange ppt. of compound is an aldehyde or ketone -> Isolate hydrazone derative, purify by recrystallisation from ethanol and measure its melting point -> Identify the particular aldehyde or ketone by matching melting point to databook values.  
  
## Distinguishing aldehydes from ketones  
### Test 1  
**Dichromate test**  
Heat with ORANGE acidified $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$  
  
**For aldehyde**:  
Orange -> green  
Solution $[Cr^{3+}(aq)]$  
  
**For ketone**:  
Remains orange  
  
### Test 2  
**Silver mirror test**  
Heat with colourless alkine $Ag^+(+NH_3)$  
  
**For aldehde**:  
Colourless solution -> silver mirror $[Ag(s)]$  
  
**For ketone**:  
Remains colourless
