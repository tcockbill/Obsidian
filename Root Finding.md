>$f(x)=x^3-4x-4$ is a continuous function  
>The equation $x^3-4x-4=0$ has exactly one real root $\alpha$  
>a. Show that $2.35 \lt \alpha \lt 2.45$  
>b. State the value of $\alpha$, correct to 1 dp  
>  
>a. $f(2.35)=(2.35)^3-4(2.35)-4 = -0.422 (3sf)$  
>$f(2.45)=(2.45)^3-4(2.45)-4 = 0.906(3sf)$  
>Since $f(2.35) \lt 0$ and $f(2.45) \gt 0$ and $f(x)$ is continuous, the root $x=\alpha$ must lie between $2.35 \lt x \lt2.45$.

>b. $\alpha = 2.4(1dp)$
