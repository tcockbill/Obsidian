## Atomic Structure and Isotopes  
  
**Atomic Structure:**  
  
*   **Atoms** are the fundamental building blocks of matter.  
*   Composed of three subatomic particles:  
    *   **Protons:** Positively charged particles located in the nucleus.  
    *   **Neutrons:** Neutral (no [[./Charge|charge]]) particles also located in the nucleus.  
    *   **Electrons:** Negatively charged particles orbiting the nucleus in electron shells.  
*   **Atomic Number (Z):**  The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.  Defines the element.  All atoms of a particular element have the same atomic number.  
*   **Mass Number (A):** The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom.  A = Z + N (where N = number of neutrons)  
*   **Neutral Atoms:** In a neutral atom, the number of protons equals the number of electrons, resulting in a net [[./Charge|charge]] of zero.  
*   **Ions:**  Atoms that have gained or lost electrons, resulting in a net [[./Charge|charge]].  
    *   **Cations:** Positively charged ions (lost electrons).  
    *   **Anions:** Negatively charged ions (gained electrons).  
  
**Isotopes:**  
  
*   **Definition:** Isotopes are atoms of the same element (same atomic number) that have different numbers of neutrons.  
*   **Consequence:**  Isotopes of an element have the same chemical properties (because they have the same electron configuration), but different mass numbers.  
*   **Notation:** Isotopes can be represented in several ways:  
    *   **Symbol Notation:**  <sup>A</sup><sub>Z</sub>X  (where X is the element symbol, A is the mass number, and Z is the atomic number).  Example: <sup>12</sup><sub>6</sub>C  
    *   **Element Name - Mass Number:** Example: Carbon-12  
*   **Atomic Mass:** The weighted average of the masses of all naturally occurring isotopes of an element. This value is found on the periodic table.  Calculated as:  âˆ‘ (% Abundance * Isotopic Mass) / 100  
*   **Radioisotopes:** Some isotopes are unstable and undergo radioactive decay, emitting particles and/or energy. These are called radioisotopes.  
  
**Key Differences:**  
  
| Feature         | Atoms                        | Isotopes                                   |  
|-----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| Definition      | Basic unit of matter       | Variants of an element with different neutrons |  
| Atomic Number   | Defines the element        | Same for all isotopes of an element       |  
| Mass Number     | Determined by protons & neutrons | Varies between isotopes of the same element |  
| Chemical Properties | Determined by electron configuration| Same for isotopes of the same element      |  
  
**Example:**  
  
*   Carbon (C) has an atomic number of 6.  
*   Carbon-12 (<sup>12</sup><sub>6</sub>C) has 6 protons and 6 neutrons.  
*   Carbon-14 (<sup>14</sup><sub>6</sub>C) has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are isotopes of each other. Carbon-14 is also a radioisotope used in carbon dating.
