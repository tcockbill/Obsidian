Carbonate ions are polyatomic anions with the formula CO₃²⁻. They are one of the most common ions on Earth and are found in a wide variety of minerals and dissolved in water.  
  
**Structure:**  
  
*   The carbonate ion consists of a central carbon atom bonded to three oxygen atoms.  
*   It has a trigonal planar geometry, meaning the three oxygen atoms are arranged in a flat triangle around the carbon atom.  
*   All carbon-oxygen bonds are equivalent due to resonance. The negative [[./Charge|charge]] is delocalized across all three oxygen atoms, giving each a partial negative [[./Charge|charge]] of -2/3.  
  
**Properties:**  
  
*   **Basicity:** Carbonate ions are bases. They readily react with [[./Acids|acids]] to form bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) and eventually carbonic acid (H₂CO₃), which decomposes into carbon dioxide and water.  This is the basis of many buffering systems.  
*   **Solubility:** Carbonates of alkali metals (e.g., sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate) are generally soluble in water. However, carbonates of alkaline earth metals (e.g., calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate) are generally insoluble in water. This difference in solubility is crucial for various geological and industrial processes.  
*   **Reactivity:** Carbonate ions can react with metal cations to form carbonate salts. These salts are often insoluble, leading to precipitation reactions.  
  
**Occurrence:**  
  
*   **Minerals:** Carbonate minerals are abundant, with examples including:  
    *   **Calcite (CaCO₃):** The primary component of limestone and marble.  
    *   **Dolomite (CaMg(CO₃)₂):** A common rock-forming mineral.  
    *   **Siderite (FeCO₃):** An iron carbonate mineral.  
    *   **Malachite (Cu₂CO₃(OH)₂):** A copper carbonate hydroxide mineral.  
*   **Water:** Carbonate ions are present in natural waters, primarily as bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻). The concentration of carbonate ions in water is influenced by pH and the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide.  This is vital for ocean buffering.  
*   **Biological systems:** Carbonate ions play a role in various biological processes, including:  
    *   **Bone formation:** Calcium carbonate is a major component of bone.  
    *   **Photosynthesis:** Bicarbonate is used by many photosynthetic organisms.  
    *   **Carbon dioxide transport in blood:** Bicarbonate ions are involved in transporting carbon dioxide from tissues to the lungs.  
  
**Reactions:**  
  
*   **Acid-Base Reaction:**  CO₃²⁻(aq) + H⁺(aq) ⇌ HCO₃⁻(aq)  
*   **Decomposition of Carbonates:** Many metal carbonates decompose upon heating to form metal oxides and carbon dioxide. For example: CaCO₃(s) → CaO(s) + CO₂(g)  
*   **Precipitation:** Metal ions + CO₃²⁻(aq) → Insoluble metal carbonate (s)  
  
**Uses:**  
  
*   **Industrial:**  
    *   **Production of glass, cement, and paper.**  
    *   **Water softening:** To remove calcium and magnesium ions.  
    *   **Neutralization of [[./Acids|acids]].**  
    *   **Detergents and cleaners.**  
*   **Agriculture:**  
    *   **Soil amendment:** To raise pH in acidic soils.  
*   **Medicine:**  
    *   **Antacids:** To neutralize stomach acid.  
  
**Related Compounds:**  
  
*   **Bicarbonate ion (HCO₃⁻):**  Also known as hydrogen carbonate. Important buffer in biological systems and geological processes.  
*   **Carbonic acid (H₂CO₃):**  Formed when carbon dioxide dissolves in water. A weak acid that decomposes into carbon dioxide and water.
