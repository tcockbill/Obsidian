**Beta Decay**  
  
Beta decay is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta particle (either an electron or a positron) is emitted from an atomic nucleus. This process allows the nucleus to move towards a more stable neutron-to-proton ratio. There are two main types of beta decay:  
  
*   **Beta-minus (β⁻) decay:** In this process, a neutron in the nucleus is converted into a proton, an electron (β⁻ particle), and an antineutrino (ν̄ₑ).  The atomic number (Z) increases by 1, while the mass number (A) remains the same.  
  
    *   Equation:  n  ->  p + e⁻ + ν̄  
  
    *   Example:  Carbon-14 decaying to Nitrogen-14:  ¹⁴C  ->  ¹⁴N + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ  
  
*   **Beta-plus (β⁺) decay:**  In this process, a proton in the nucleus is converted into a neutron, a positron (β⁺ particle), and a neutrino (νₑ).  The atomic number (Z) decreases by 1, while the mass number (A) remains the same. Beta-plus decay can only occur if the mass of the parent nucleus is greater than the mass of the daughter nucleus plus the mass of the positron.  
  
    *   Equation: p  ->  n + e⁺ + νₑ  
  
    *   Example: Sodium-22 decaying to Neon-22: ²²Na -> ²²Ne + e⁺ + νₑ  
  
**Key Characteristics:**  
  
*   **Conservation Laws:** Beta decay adheres to the fundamental conservation laws of physics, including conservation of energy, momentum, [[./Charge|charge]], and lepton number.  
  
*   **Weak Nuclear Force:** Beta decay is governed by the weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces in nature.  
  
*   **Energy Release (Q-value):**  The process releases energy (Q-value), which is shared by the emitted beta particle and the (anti)neutrino.  This energy determines the kinetic energy of the emitted particles.  The Q-value must be positive for the decay to occur spontaneously.  
  
*   **Neutrino/Antineutrino Emission:**  The emission of a neutrino or antineutrino is crucial for conservation of lepton number.  Electrons and neutrinos are leptons, while protons and neutrons are baryons.  
  
**Applications:**  
  
*   **Radioactive Dating:** Carbon-14 dating utilizes beta decay to determine the age of organic materials.  
*   **Medical Imaging:**  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans use positron-emitting isotopes (produced through beta+ decay) for medical imaging.  
*   **Nuclear Medicine:** Beta-emitting isotopes are used in targeted therapies to treat certain types of cancer.  
*   **Nuclear Reactors:** Beta decay occurs as a consequence of nuclear fission processes in reactors.
