Ammonium ions are polyatomic cations with the chemical formula NH₄⁺. They are formed when ammonia (NH₃), a weak base, accepts a proton (H⁺). This protonation results in the nitrogen atom forming four [[./Covalent bonds|covalent bonds]], giving it a positive [[./Charge|charge]].  
  
**Properties:**  
  
*   **Solubility:** Ammonium salts are generally soluble in water.  
*   **Acidity:** While ammonium *ions* are not strong [[./Acids|acids]], they are weakly acidic. In aqueous solutions, they can donate a proton back to water, regenerating ammonia and hydronium ions (H₃O⁺). This [[../Chemistry/Miss Eggleton/Equilibrium|equilibrium]] contributes to a slightly acidic pH.

>NH₄⁺(aq) + H₂O(l) ⇌ NH₃(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)  
  
*   **Odorless:** Ammonium ions themselves are odorless. The characteristic pungent smell often associated with ammonia-containing solutions is due to the presence of free ammonia (NH₃).  
*   **No Color:** Ammonium salts are typically colorless.  
  
**Occurrence and Uses:**  
  
*   **Fertilizers:** Ammonium salts, such as ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), ammonium sulfate ((NH₄)₂SO₄), and ammonium phosphate (NH₄)₃PO₄, are widely used as nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture. They provide plants with a readily available source of nitrogen, an essential nutrient for growth.  
*   **Cleaning Products:** Ammonium hydroxide (NH₄OH), also known as ammonia solution or household ammonia, is used in cleaning products.  It is a strong base and effective at removing grease and grime. However, it must be used with caution due to its corrosive properties and the release of ammonia gas.  
*   **Laboratory Reagent:** Ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) is a common reagent used in various laboratory applications, including as a buffer solution component.  
*   **Batteries:** Ammonium chloride is a component of some dry-cell batteries.  
*   **Food Additive:** Certain ammonium compounds are used as food additives, for example as dough conditioners or leavening agents.  
*   **Medical Applications:** Ammonium salts have limited medical applications. Ammonium chloride has been used as an expectorant and a urinary acidifier.  
  
**Environmental Considerations:**  
  
*   **Water Pollution:** Excessive use of ammonium-based fertilizers can lead to nitrogen pollution in waterways.  Nitrogen runoff can contribute to eutrophication, the excessive growth of algae that depletes oxygen in the water, harming aquatic life.  
*   **Atmospheric Pollution:**  Ammonia (released from ammonium compounds) can contribute to the formation of particulate matter in the atmosphere, affecting air quality and human health.  
  
**Key Compounds:**  
  
*   Ammonium Chloride (NH₄Cl)  
*   Ammonium Nitrate (NH₄NO₃)  
*   Ammonium Sulfate ((NH₄)₂SO₄)  
*   Ammonium Phosphate ((NH₄)₃PO₄)  
*   Ammonium Hydroxide (NH₄OH)  
  
**Formation Reactions:**  
  
Ammonium ions are formed through the protonation of ammonia:  
  
>[!Chemical-formula]  
>NH₃(g) + H⁺(aq)  ->  NH₄⁺(aq)  
  
This reaction is highly exothermic. Ammonia can accept a proton from a strong acid (like HCl or H₂SO₄) or from water (though the [[../Chemistry/Miss Eggleton/Equilibrium|equilibrium]] favors NH₃ and H₂O).  
  
**Reactions:**  
  
Ammonium salts can decompose upon heating, often releasing ammonia gas. The specific decomposition products depend on the anion. For example:  
  
>[!chemical-formula]  
>NH₄Cl(s)  -> NH₃(g) + HCl(g)  
  
The decomposition of ammonium nitrate can be explosive under certain conditions.
