# Acids  
  
## Definition  
  
Acids are substances that:  
  
*   Donate protons (H⁺) in a chemical reaction (Brønsted-Lowry definition).  
*   Accept electron pairs (Lewis definition).  
*   Increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in aqueous solutions (Arrhenius definition).  
*   Have a pH less than 7.  
*   Taste sour (caution: do not taste unknown substances!).  
*   React with bases to form salts and water.  
*   Can corrode or dissolve certain materials.  
  
## Properties  
  
*   **Taste:** Sour (but should not be used as a primary identification method).  
*   **pH:** < 7 (measured on a pH scale from 0-14).  
*   **Reactivity:** React with metals to produce hydrogen gas.  
*   **Corrosivity:** Can dissolve or damage materials like metals and some fabrics.  
*   **Litmus Paper:** Turn blue litmus paper red.  
*   **Electrical Conductivity:** Acidic solutions are often conductive due to the presence of ions.  
  
## Types of Acids  
  
*   **Strong Acids:** Completely dissociate into ions in water. Examples include:  
    *   Hydrochloric acid (HCl)  
    *   Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄)  
    *   Nitric acid (HNO₃)  
    *   Hydrobromic acid (HBr)  
    *   Hydroiodic acid (HI)  
    *   Perchloric acid (HClO₄)  
    *   Chloric acid (HClO₃)  
*   **Weak Acids:** Only partially dissociate into ions in water. Examples include:  
    *   Acetic acid (CH₃COOH)  
    *   Carbonic acid (H₂CO₃)  
    *   Citric acid (C₆H₈O₇)  
    *   Formic acid (HCOOH)  
    *   Hydrofluoric acid (HF)  
*   **Organic Acids:** Contain carbon. Often weak acids. Examples include:  
    *   Acetic acid (vinegar)  
    *   Citric acid (in citrus fruits)  
    *   Lactic acid (in sour milk and muscles)  
*   **Inorganic Acids:** Generally do not contain carbon. Examples include:  
    *   Hydrochloric acid  
    *   Sulfuric acid  
    *   Nitric acid  
  
## Acid-Base Reactions (Neutralization)  
  
Acids react with bases in a *neutralization reaction* to form a salt and water.  
  
>[!chemical-formula] Example:  
>HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) -> NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)  
  
(Hydrochloric acid + Sodium hydroxide -> Sodium chloride + Water)  
  
## Common Uses  
  
*   **Industry:** Production of fertilizers, plastics, synthetic fibers, detergents.  
*   **Food Industry:** Flavoring, preservation.  
*   **Cleaning:** Removing rust, descaling.  
*   **Batteries:** Sulfuric acid in lead-acid batteries.  
*   **Pharmaceuticals:** Synthesis of drugs.  
  
## Safety Precautions  
  
*   **Handling:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, goggles, and lab coats, when handling acids.  
*   **Dilution:** Always add acid to water, never water to acid, to avoid splattering due to the heat generated.  
*   **Ventilation:** Work in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.  
*   **Storage:** Store acids in designated, properly labeled containers, away from incompatible materials.  
*   **Spills:** Clean up spills immediately following established protocols and using appropriate neutralizing agents.  
*   **First Aid:** Know the proper first aid procedures for acid exposure (e.g., flushing with copious amounts of water).
