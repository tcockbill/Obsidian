## Alkenes: Unsaturated Hydrocarbons with Double Bonds  
  
**Definition:** Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons characterized by the presence of one or more carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) in their molecular structure. This unsaturation makes them more reactive than [[../Chemistry/Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]].  
  
**General Formula:** CₙH₂ₙ (for alkenes with one double bond)  
  
**Nomenclature (IUPAC):**  
  
*   Identify the longest continuous carbon chain containing the double bond. This forms the parent chain.  
*   Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain so that the double bond has the *lowest possible* number. The double bond number takes precedence over alkyl substituents.  
*   Name the compound as you would an alkane, but replace the "-ane" suffix with "-ene". Use the lowest number assigned to the double bond to indicate its position (e.g., but-2-ene).  
*   Name and number any substituents as you would for [[../Chemistry/Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]].  
*   Use prefixes like *cis-* and *trans-* or *E* and *Z* to indicate stereoisomerism around the double bond if applicable (see below).  
  
**Examples:**  
  
*   Ethene (ethylene): CH₂=CH₂  
*   Propene (propylene): CH₃CH=CH₂  
*   But-1-ene: CH₂=CHCH₂CH₃  
*   But-2-ene: CH₃CH=CHCH₃  
  
**Isomerism:**  
  
*   **Structural Isomerism:** Alkenes can exhibit structural isomerism (different connectivity of atoms) due to the different positions of the double bond or branching.  
*   **Geometric Isomerism (Cis-Trans/E-Z):**  Restricted rotation around the double bond can lead to geometric isomers (also called *cis-trans* isomers).  
    *   ***Cis-***: Substituents are on the *same* side of the double bond.  
    *   ***Trans-***: Substituents are on *opposite* sides of the double bond.  
    *   **E/Z Nomenclature:**  Used when *cis-trans* nomenclature is ambiguous (e.g., when more than two different substituents are attached to the double-bonded carbons).  Based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules:  
        *   *Z* (from German *zusammen* meaning "together"):  Higher priority groups are on the *same* side of the double bond.  
        *   *E* (from German *entgegen* meaning "opposite"):  Higher priority groups are on *opposite* sides of the double bond.  
  
**Physical Properties:**  
  
*   Similar to [[../Chemistry/Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]]: Generally nonpolar, insoluble in water, and soluble in nonpolar solvents.  
*   Boiling points increase with increasing molecular weight.  
*   *Cis* isomers generally have lower melting points and higher boiling points than *trans* isomers.  
  
**Chemical Properties/Reactions:**  
  
The double bond in alkenes is a region of high electron density and is therefore susceptible to attack by electrophiles (electron-seeking species).  Key reactions include:  
  
*   **Addition Reactions:**  
    *   **Hydrogenation:** Addition of H₂ across the double bond (requires a metal catalyst like Pt, Pd, or Ni) to form an alkane.  
    *   **Halogenation:** Addition of X₂ (Cl₂, Br₂) across the double bond to form a vicinal dihalide.  
    *   **Hydrohalogenation:** Addition of HX (HCl, HBr, HI) across the double bond to form a haloalkane.  **Markovnikov's Rule** generally applies (the hydrogen adds to the carbon with more hydrogens already, and the halogen adds to the more substituted carbon).  
    *   **Hydration:** Addition of H₂O across the double bond (requires an acid catalyst like H₂SO₄) to form an alcohol. **Markovnikov's Rule** applies.  
    *   **Oxymercuration-Demercuration:**  A two-step process for alcohol synthesis that avoids rearrangements sometimes seen in acid-catalyzed hydration. **Markovnikov's Rule** applies.  
    *   **Hydroboration-Oxidation:**  A two-step process for alcohol synthesis that gives **anti-Markovnikov** addition of water.  
*   **Polymerization:** Alkenes can undergo chain-growth polymerization to form polymers (e.g., ethene polymerizes to form polyethylene).  
*   **Oxidation:**  
    *   **Combustion:** Alkenes burn in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water.  
    *   **Epoxidation:**  Reaction with peroxyacids (e.g., mCPBA) to form epoxides (cyclic ethers).  
    *   **Ozonolysis:**  Reaction with ozone (O₃) followed by reductive workup (e.g., with Zn/H₂O or DMS) to cleave the double bond and form aldehydes and/or ketones.  
    *   **Potassium Permanganate (KMnO₄):** Cold, dilute KMnO₄ solution can react with alkenes to form vicinal diols (syn addition).  Hot, concentrated KMnO₄ solution cleaves the double bond, forming ketones, carboxylic [[./Acids|acids]], and/or CO₂ depending on the substituents on the alkene.  
  
**Uses:**  
  
Alkenes are important industrial chemicals used:  
  
*   As monomers for the production of polymers (plastics).  
*   As intermediates in the synthesis of other organic compounds.  
*   As fuels (e.g., ethylene as a ripening agent for fruits).
