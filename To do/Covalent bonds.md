A **covalent bond** is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. These shared electron pairs are known as *bonding pairs* or *shared pairs*, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding.  
  
**Key Characteristics:**  
  
*   **Sharing of Electrons:**  Unlike ionic bonds where electrons are transferred, covalent bonds involve atoms sharing electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration (usually an octet).  
*   **Formation:** Covalent bonds typically form between two nonmetal atoms.  
*   **Strength:** The strength of a covalent bond is related to the number of shared electron pairs.  Single bonds are weaker than double bonds, which are weaker than triple bonds.  
*   **Directional:** Covalent bonds are directional, meaning they have specific orientations in space, leading to distinct molecular shapes.  This directionality is crucial for determining a molecule's properties and reactivity.  
*   **Lower Melting and Boiling Points:** Compounds with covalent bonds generally have lower melting and boiling points compared to ionic compounds because the intermolecular forces are weaker.  
*   **Poor Conductivity:**  Covalent compounds are generally poor conductors of electricity because there are no free-moving ions or electrons. (Exception: Graphite)  
  
**Types of Covalent Bonds:**  
  
*   **Single Bond:** One pair of electrons is shared (e.g., H-H in hydrogen gas, H₂).  
*   **Double Bond:** Two pairs of electrons are shared (e.g., O=O in oxygen gas, O₂).  
*   **Triple Bond:** Three pairs of electrons are shared (e.g., N≡N in nitrogen gas, N₂).  
*   **Polar Covalent Bond:** Unequal sharing of electrons due to differences in electronegativity.  This creates a partial positive (δ+) and partial negative (δ-) charge on the atoms involved (e.g., H-Cl).  The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polar the bond.  
*   **Nonpolar Covalent Bond:** Equal sharing of electrons because the electronegativity difference between the atoms is very small or zero (e.g., C-H).  
  
**Electronegativity and Polarity:**  
  
The *electronegativity* of an atom is its ability to attract electrons towards itself in a chemical bond.  The difference in electronegativity between two bonded atoms determines the polarity of the bond.  
  
*   Large difference in electronegativity: Ionic bond  
*   Moderate difference in electronegativity: Polar covalent bond  
*   Small or no difference in electronegativity: Nonpolar covalent bond  
  
**Representing Covalent Bonds:**  
  
*   **Lewis Structures:** Diagrams that show the arrangement of atoms and electrons in a molecule, including shared and unshared (lone pair) electrons.  
*   **Structural Formulas:**  Represent atoms with their symbols and use lines to represent covalent bonds (single, double, or triple).  
  
**Examples:**  
  
*   **Water (H₂O):** Each hydrogen atom shares an electron with the oxygen atom, forming two polar covalent bonds.  
*   **Methane (CH₄):** Carbon shares electrons with four hydrogen atoms, forming four nonpolar (or very weakly polar) covalent bonds.  
*   **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** Carbon forms two double bonds with two oxygen atoms.
