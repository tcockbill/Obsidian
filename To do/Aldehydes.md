## Aldehydes  
  
**General Formula:** R-CHO (where R is an alkyl or aryl group and CHO is the carbonyl group)  
  
**Key Characteristics:**  
  
*   **Carbonyl Group (C=O):**  A carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom. This is the reactive center of aldehydes.  
*   **Terminal Carbonyl:** The carbonyl group is always at the *end* of the carbon chain, attached to at least one hydrogen atom. This distinguishes them from ketones.  
  
**Nomenclature:**  
  
*   **IUPAC Naming:**  
    *   Identify the longest continuous carbon chain containing the carbonyl group.  
    *   Replace the "-e" ending of the alkane name with "-al".  
    *   Number the carbon chain such that the carbonyl carbon is always carbon number 1 (no need to include a number in the name).  
    *   Name and number any substituents on the carbon chain.  
*   **Common Names:** Many simple aldehydes have common names (e.g., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde).  
  
**Physical Properties:**  
  
*   **Polarity:**  Aldehydes are polar molecules due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group.  
*   **Boiling Points:** Higher boiling points than [[../Chemistry/Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]] of similar molecular weight due to dipole-dipole interactions. However, lower boiling points than alcohols due to the absence of hydrogen bonding between aldehyde molecules.  
*   **Solubility:**  Smaller aldehydes are soluble in water due to hydrogen bonding with water molecules. Solubility decreases as the size of the alkyl/aryl group (R) increases.  
  
**Chemical Properties:**  
  
*   **Reactivity:** Aldehydes are generally *more* reactive than ketones due to the less steric hindrance around the carbonyl carbon and the electron-donating effect of only one alkyl/aryl group.  
*   **Oxidation:** Aldehydes are easily oxidized to carboxylic [[./Acids|acids]]. This is a key distinguishing reaction.  
    *   Examples of oxidizing agents:  Potassium permanganate (KMnO₄), chromic acid (H₂CrO₄), Tollens' reagent (Ag(NH₃)₂⁺) (forms a silver mirror).  
*   **Reduction:** Aldehydes can be reduced to primary alcohols.  
    *   Examples of reducing agents: Sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), Lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), Hydrogen (H₂) with a metal catalyst (e.g., Ni, Pt, Pd).  
*   **Nucleophilic Addition:** The carbonyl carbon is electrophilic (electron-deficient) and susceptible to attack by nucleophiles.  
    *   Examples: Addition of alcohols (hemiacetal/acetal formation), Grignard reagents, cyanide (cyanohydrin formation).  
*   **Addition Reactions** Aldehydes easily undergo addition reactions with a variety of reagents.  
  
**Preparation Methods:**  
  
*   **Oxidation of Primary Alcohols:** Using mild oxidizing agents to prevent further oxidation to carboxylic [[./Acids|acids]]. Pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) is a common reagent.  
    *   R-CH₂OH  --[PCC]--> R-CHO  
*   **Ozonolysis of [[./Alkenes|Alkenes]]:** Treatment of [[./Alkenes|alkenes]] with ozone (O₃) followed by reductive workup (e.g., with zinc and acetic acid).  
*   **Reduction of Acid Chlorides:** Using a poisoned catalyst (e.g., Lindlar's catalyst) to control the reduction.  
*   **Stephen Reduction:**  Reduction of nitriles with SnCl₂ and HCl, followed by hydrolysis.  
  
**Examples & Applications:**  
  
*   **Formaldehyde (HCHO):** Used in the production of resins, adhesives (e.g., urea-formaldehyde resins), and embalming fluids.  
*   **Acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO):** Used in the production of acetic acid, perfumes, and plastics.  
*   **Benzaldehyde (C₆H₅CHO):** Found in almonds and used as a flavoring agent.  
*   **Vanillin (C₈H₈O₃):** The primary flavor component of vanilla beans.  
*   **Cinnamaldehyde (C₉H₈O):** Gives cinnamon its characteristic flavor and odor.  
  
**Reactions (Examples):**  
  
*   **Tollens' Test:**  R-CHO + 2Ag(NH₃)₂⁺ + 3OH⁻ → RCOO⁻ + 2Ag(s) + 4NH₃ + 2H₂O (Silver mirror formation)  
*   **Cannizzaro Reaction:** (Disproportionation reaction of aldehydes lacking α-hydrogens in the presence of strong base)  
    2 R-CHO + NaOH → R-CH₂OH + RCOONa  
* **Wittig Reaction** Reaction of aldehyde or ketone with phosphonium ylide to produce an alkene.
