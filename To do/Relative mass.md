**Relative Atomic Mass (Ar)**  
  
The relative atomic mass (Ar) of an element is the weighted average mass of its atoms, compared to 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom.  It is a dimensionless quantity (i.e., it has no units).  It's a *relative* value, meaning it's not an absolute mass, but a mass relative to a standard.  
  
* **Definition:** The weighted average of the masses of the isotopes of an element relative to 1/12th of the mass of an atom of carbon-12.  
  
* **Importance:** Ar is essential for calculating the molar mass (gram formula mass) of a substance. It allows us to relate mass to the number of atoms/moles.  
  
* **Calculating Ar:**  
  
   1. **Identify the isotopes:** Determine all the naturally occurring isotopes of the element and their isotopic masses.  
   2. **Determine abundances:** Find the relative abundance (percentage or decimal) of each isotope.  This is often expressed as a percentage abundance.  
   3. **Calculate the weighted average:** Multiply the isotopic mass of each isotope by its relative abundance (expressed as a decimal) and sum the results.  
  
   Formula:  
  
   Ar = (Mass of isotope 1 × Abundance of isotope 1) + (Mass of isotope 2 × Abundance of isotope 2) + ...  
  
   *Example:*  
  
   Chlorine has two isotopes: chlorine-35 (75.77% abundance) and chlorine-37 (24.23% abundance).  
  
   Ar(Cl) = (35 × 0.7577) + (37 × 0.2423) = 26.52 + 8.96 = 35.48  
  
**Relative Formula Mass (Mr)**  
  
The relative formula mass (Mr) is used for compounds and is the sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in the formula unit.  Like Ar, it is also a dimensionless quantity.  
  
* **Definition:** The sum of the relative atomic masses of the atoms in the formula unit as given in the formula for the substance.  
  
* **Calculating Mr:**  
  
   1. **Write the chemical formula:** Know the correct formula for the compound.  
   2. **Look up Ar values:** Find the relative atomic mass of each element present in the compound (from a periodic table).  
   3. **Multiply and add:** Multiply the Ar of each element by the number of atoms of that element in the formula unit.  Then, add all these results together.  
  
   *Example:*  
  
   Calculate the Mr of Water (H₂O)  
  
   Ar(H) = 1  
   Ar(O) = 16  
  
   Mr(H₂O) = (2 × 1) + (1 × 16) = 2 + 16 = 18  
  
**Key Differences:**  
  
*   **Ar:** Applies to individual elements (atoms).  
*   **Mr:** Applies to compounds (formula units).  
  
**Why use Relative Masses?**  
  
Absolute masses of atoms are very small and cumbersome to work with directly. Using relative masses simplifies calculations and allows chemists to compare the masses of different elements and compounds on a manageable scale. It is directly tied to the concept of the mole and stoichiometric calculations.
