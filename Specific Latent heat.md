# Specific latent heat  
 >[!formula] Specific latent heat equation  
 >$$Q=mL$$  
 >$Q$ is the amount of energy released or absorbed during the change of phase of a substance (in kJ)  
 >$m$ is the mass of the substance (in kg)  
 >$L$ is the specific latent heat for a particular substance (in $kJkg^{-1}$)  
  
The specific latent heat is the amount of energy required to convert 1kg of a substance from a solid to a liquid (or vice-versa) without a change in the temperature of the surroundings - all absorbed energy goes into the phase change - is known as the specific latent heat of fusion  
  
Likewise, the amount of energy required to convert 1kg of a substance from a liquid to a gas (or vice-versa) without a change in the external temperatute is known as the specific latent heat of vaporization for that substance  
  
Two of the more common forms of latent heat (or enthalpies or energies) encountered are latent heat of fusion (melting) and the latent heat of vaporisation (boiling). These names describe the direction of energy flow when changing from one phase
