# Projectile motion  
2. From Point $O$, with velocity $\left[^{3U}_{4U}\right]$. The ball lands at point $H$, which is at the same horizontal level as $O$.  
	1. Show that the time taken by the ball to travel from $O$ to $H$ is $\frac{8U}{g}$  
	 S=not needed  
	 U=4U  
	 V=0  
	 A-g  
	 T=?  
	 $V=U+AT$  
	 $0=4U+(-g) \times ?$  
	 $g?=4U$  
	 $?=\frac{4U}{g}$  
	 Total flight time = $2\left(\frac{4U}{g}\right)=\frac{8U}{g}$  
	2. Find, in terms of $g$ and $U$, the distance $OH$  
	Distance = [[../../To do/Speed|Speed]] * Time  
	$d=3U \times \frac{8U}{g} = \frac{24U}{g}$  
	3. Find, in terms of $U$, the initial speed of the ball  
	initial speed = $\sqrt{(3U)^2+(4U)^2} = 5U$  
	4. Find, in terms of $g$ and $U$, the two times during the flight from $O$ to $H$ when the ball is moving with speed $\sqrt{18}U$
