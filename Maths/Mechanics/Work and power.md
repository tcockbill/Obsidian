# Work done  
>[!formula] Formulae for work and power  
>$\text{work done} = \text{force} \times \text{distance}$  
>$\text{work} = Fx$  
>  
>$\text{power} = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{time}}$  
>$\text{power} = \frac{F \times x}{t}$  
>$\text{power} = Fv$  
  
  
>[!formula] For a variable force  
>$\text{work} = \int ^x _0 F \thinspace dx$  
  
>[!example] Example 1  
>A car of mass 1000 kg has a maximum speed of $40 ms^{-1}$ when travelling on a straight horizontal racetrack  
>The maximum power output of the car's engine is 48kW  
>The total resistance force experienced by the car can be modelled as being proportional to the car's speed  
>Find the possible acceleration of hte car when it is travelling at $25 ms^{-1}$ on the straight, horizontal racetrack  
>  
>Equilibrium at max speed - $F=kv$  
>$p=Fv$  
>$48000 = F \times 40$  
  
## Examples  
  
```tikz  
\begin{document}  
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]  
  
\draw[line width = 0.5mm] (0,0) rectangle (4,2);  
\node at (2,1) {450000 kg};  
\draw[-latex] (0,1) -- (-4,1) node[left] {\huge $\frac{450N^2}{4}$};  
\draw[-latex] (4,1) -- (8,1);  
  
\end{tikzpicture}  
\end{document}  
```
