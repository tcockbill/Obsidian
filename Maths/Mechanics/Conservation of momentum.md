## Conservation of Momentum  
  
**Definition:**  
  
The total momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external forces act on it.  In simpler terms, momentum cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred.  
  
**Mathematical Representation:**  
  
For a system of two or more objects:  
  
*   **Total Momentum Before = Total Momentum After**  
  
    Which can be expressed as:  
  
    `m₁v₁ᵢ + m₂v₂ᵢ + ... = m₁v₁f + m₂v₂f + ...`  
  
    Where:  
  
    *   `m₁`, `m₂`, ... are the masses of the objects  
    *   `v₁ᵢ`, `v₂ᵢ`, ... are the initial velocities of the objects  
    *   `v₁f`, `v₂f`, ... are the final velocities of the objects  
  
**Key Concepts and Conditions:**  
  
*   **Closed System:** A system where no mass enters or leaves.  
*   **Isolated System:** A system where no external forces act on it.  External forces like friction, [[../../To do/Gravity|gravity]] (if the system isn't the Earth), or applied forces violate the principle.  
*   **Vector Quantity:** Momentum is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. Therefore, you must consider the directions of the velocities when applying the conservation of momentum.  Conventionally, right and up are positive and left and down are negative.  
  
**Applications:**  
  
*   **Collisions:** The most common application.  This can be:  
    *   **Elastic collisions:** Kinetic energy is conserved (e.g., billiard balls colliding).  
    *   **Inelastic collisions:** Kinetic energy is not conserved (e.g., a car crash, where energy is lost to heat and deformation). Perfectly inelastic collisions occur when objects stick together after the collision.  
  
*   **Explosions:**  The initial momentum of the system (often zero) is equal to the vector sum of the momenta of the fragments after the explosion.  
  
*   **Rocket Propulsion:**  Rockets expel exhaust gases backwards, which creates forward momentum for the rocket.  
  
**Solving Problems:**  
  
1.  **Identify the system:** Clearly define what objects are included in your system.  
2.  **Check for external forces:** Determine if any external forces are acting on the system. If they are significant, conservation of momentum might not be applicable, or it can only be applied in one dimension where there are no external forces.  
3.  **Define directions:** Establish a coordinate system (x, y, z) and define positive and negative directions.  
4.  **Write the equation:** Write the conservation of momentum equation, including initial and final velocities for each object. Remember to use vector components if necessary.  
5.  **Solve for the unknown:** Solve the equation(s) to find the unknown variable.  
  
**Examples:**  
  
*   **Recoil of a gun:** When a gun is fired, the bullet moves forward, and the gun recoils backward to conserve momentum.  
*   **Two ice skaters pushing off each other:**  If two skaters stand still and then push off of each other, they will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.  
  
**Limitations:**  
  
*   Does not apply to open systems where mass enters or leaves.  
*   External forces invalidate the principle.  
*   Relativistic effects become significant at very high speeds (approaching the speed of light).  
  
**Related Concepts:**  
  
*   Impulse  
*   Newton's Laws of Motion  
*   Kinetic Energy  
*   Center of Mass
