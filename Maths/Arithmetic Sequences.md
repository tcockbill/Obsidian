## Arithmetic Sequences  
  
**Definition:** An arithmetic sequence (or arithmetic progression) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference, denoted by *d*.  
  
**General Form:**  
  
An arithmetic sequence can be written in the general form:  
  
a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, ...  
  
Where:  
  
*   `a` is the first term of the sequence.  
*   `d` is the common difference.  
  
**Formula for the nth term (a<sub>n</sub>):**  
  
The *n*th term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the following formula:  
  
a<sub>n</sub> = a + (n - 1)d  
  
Where:  
  
*   a<sub>n</sub> is the *n*th term  
*   `a` is the first term  
*   `n` is the term number  
*   `d` is the common difference  
  
**Formula for the Sum of the First n terms (S<sub>n</sub>):**  
  
The sum of the first *n* terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:  
  
S<sub>n</sub> = n/2 * (a + a<sub>n</sub>)  
  
or, equivalently:  
  
S<sub>n</sub> = n/2 * [2a + (n - 1)d]  
  
Where:  
  
*   S<sub>n</sub> is the sum of the first *n* terms  
*   `n` is the number of terms  
*   `a` is the first term  
*   a<sub>n</sub> is the *n*th term  
*   `d` is the common difference  
  
**Examples:**  
  
*   The sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, ... is an arithmetic sequence with `a = 2` and `d = 3`.  
*   The sequence 10, 7, 4, 1, -2, ... is an arithmetic sequence with `a = 10` and `d = -3`.  
  
**Key Characteristics:**  
  
*   The difference between any two consecutive terms is constant.  
*   The terms increase or decrease linearly.  
*   Arithmetic sequences can be easily identified by looking for a constant additive pattern.  
  
**Applications:**  
  
Arithmetic sequences have numerous applications in various fields, including:  
  
*   Finance (e.g., simple interest calculations)  
*   Physics (e.g., constant acceleration)  
*   Computer Science (e.g., indexing in arrays)  
*   Problem-solving in mathematics.
