## Arc Length and Sector Area (Radians)  
  
### Arc Length  
  
*   **Definition:** The arc length, often denoted by *s*, is the distance along the curved line of an arc.  
  
*   **Formula:**  When the angle is measured in radians, the arc length is given by:  
    `s = rθ`  
    where:  
    *   *s* = arc length  
    *   *r* = radius of the circle  
    *   *θ* = central angle in radians  
  
*   **Intuition:** Think of the radius as a "unit" of arc length at 1 radian. A radian is defined such that the radius "wraps around" the circle 2π times.  So, the arc length is simply the radius multiplied by how many radians the central angle covers.  
  
*   **Example:** A circle has a radius of 5 cm. Find the arc length subtended by a central angle of π/3 radians.  
    `s = (5 cm) * (π/3) = (5π/3) cm ≈ 5.24 cm`  
  
### Sector Area  
  
*   **Definition:** The sector area, often denoted by *A*, is the area enclosed by an arc and two radii of a circle.  
  
*   **Formula:** When the angle is measured in radians, the sector area is given by:  
    `A = (1/2)r²θ`  
    where:  
    *   *A* = sector area  
    *   *r* = radius of the circle  
    *   *θ* = central angle in radians  
  
*   **Derivation (Optional):**  The area of a sector is a fraction of the total area of the circle (πr²). The fraction is determined by the proportion of the central angle (θ) to the total angle around the circle (2π radians).  
    `A = (θ / 2π) * πr² = (1/2)r²θ`  
  
*   **Example:** A circle has a radius of 8 inches. Find the area of the sector subtended by a central angle of 3π/4 radians.  
    `A = (1/2) * (8 inches)² * (3π/4) = (1/2) * 64 * (3π/4) = 24π square inches ≈ 75.40 square inches`  
  
### Key Relationships & Considerations  
  
*   **Radians are Crucial:** These formulas *only* work when the angle *θ* is measured in radians. If given degrees, convert to radians first using:  
    `radians = (degrees * π) / 180`  
  
*   **Units:**  Make sure your units are consistent. If the radius is in centimeters, the arc length will be in centimeters, and the sector area will be in square centimeters.  
  
*   **Visualizations:** Drawing a diagram helps understand the relationship between the radius, angle, arc length, and sector area.  
  
### Practice Problems  
  
*   A circle has a radius of 12 meters.  What is the arc length cut off by a central angle of 2.5 radians? What is the sector area?  
  
*   The arc length of a sector is 15 cm, and the radius of the circle is 6 cm. Find the measure of the central angle in radians. What is the sector area?

Arc length $= s = \frac{\theta^r}{2 \pi} \times 2 \pi r = \theta^r \times r$  
Sector area $= A = \frac{\theta^r}{2 \pi} \times \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \theta^r \times r^2$
