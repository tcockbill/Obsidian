# Example[[./Hypothesis testing|Hypothesis testing]][[./Binomial Distribution|Binomial Distribution]][[./The expectation of binomial distribution|The expectation of binomial distribution]]   
The standard treatment for a particular disease has a $\frac{2}{5}$ probability of success. A researcher has produced a new drug which has been successful with 11 out of 20 patients. He claims that the new drug is more effective than the standard treatment. Test, at a 5% significance level, the claim made by the researcher.  
Let X be the number of successful treatments  
X~B(20,P)  
H$_0$: P=0.4  
H$_1$: P>0.4  
P($x\ge11$)=0.128  
Accept H$_0$ there is insufficient evidence to say that the new drug is a more effective treatment  
  
# Exercise 1  
1| Jessica complains that the dice she is using is biased so that she is less likely to get a 6 she decides to test at the 5% significance level the hypothesis that the dice is biased against a 6  
i| write down the null and [[./Alternative Hypothesis|alternative hypothesis]] that jessica will use  
H$_0$: P=$\frac{1}{6}$  
H$_1$: P<$\frac{1}{6}$  
ii| P(x$\le$ 1)=0.13  we can accept the [[./Null Hypothesis|null hypothesis]] as the p-value is greater than the significance level  
  
2| 10% significance level  more likely to get 1 than any other number on a die  
i| null and [[./Alternative Hypothesis|alternative hypothesis]]  
H$_0$: P=$\frac{1}{6}$  
H$_1$: P>$\frac{1}{6}$  
ii| P(x$\ge5$)= 0.036   we cannot accept the [[./Null Hypothesis|null hypothesis]] as the p-value is below the significance level  
  
# Exercise 2  
1| H$_0$: P=0.4  
H$_1$: P<0.4  
P(x$\le2$)=0.00546  
The P-value is less than the significance level, therefore the head of department has reason to be concerned  
  
2|H$_0$: P=0.5  
H$_1$: P>0.5  
P(x$\ge6$)=0.145   
The coin is not biased as 0.145 is greater than 0.05  
  
3|H$_0$: P=0.5  
H$_1$: P>0.5  
P(x$\ge12$)=0.038  
The coin could be biased as the P-value is less than the significance level  
  
  
$P(Y=1)=P(Y\ge3)\therefore{P(Y=1)=0.25=b}$   
$P(Y=0)=P(Y=2)-0.1\therefore{P(Y=2)=0.2=c}$
