# Null hypothesis  
The Null hypothesis ($H_0$), is a fundamental concept in statistical [[./Hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]]. It is a statement suggesting that there is no effect, no difference or no relationship between variables, and it serves as the default or starting assumption that researchers aim to test.  
  
The null hypothesis typically represents the status quo or a statement of no change.  
- There is no affect compared to a placebo $(H_0:\mu = \mu _0)$.  
- There is no difference in height between the two populations $(H_0:\mu _1 = \mu _2)$  
  
This is tested against the [[./Alternative Hypothesis|alternative hypothesis]] ($H_1$), which proposes there is a difference
