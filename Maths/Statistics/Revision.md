1. $P(X=x)=\frac{kx}{3}$ for x=1,2,3, if two sucessive values are generated independantly find the probability that the two values are equal  
$\frac{k}{3}+\frac{2k}{3}+\frac{3k}{3}=1$  
$\therefore \frac{6k}{3}=1$  
$\therefore k=\frac{1}{2}$  
$P(x=x)=(\frac{0.5}{3})^2\times (\frac{1}{3})^2\times (\frac{1.5}{3})^2=\frac{7}{18}$  
  
1. Alex has cards with the numbers 2,3,5 and 6 on. Two cards are selected at random (without replacement) and hte product of the numners calculated. Calculate the probability of getting a product greater than 10  
Probability of each card first time is $\frac{1}{4}$ and second time is $\frac{1}{3}$  
The only products less than or equal to 10 are 2,3 , 2,5 , 5,2 , 3,2  
So prob is $1-(\frac{1}{4}\times{\frac{1}{3}})\times4=2/3$  
  
2. Est. mean is 14. Est s.d.  
$\frac{44+13x+105+66}{15+x}=\frac{217+13x}{15+x}=14$  
$217+13x=210+14x$  
$x=7$  
s.d.=1.98
