# Alternative hypothesis  
The alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) contradicts the [[./Null Hypothesis|null hypothesis]] ($H_0$) to suggest that there is an effect or a difference between the two situations.  
  
The hypothesis can either be:  
- Two-tailed: $H_1: \mu \ne \mu _0$ (suggesting that the parameter is different from the null value in either direction)  
- One-tailed: $H_1:\mu \gt \mu_0$ (suggesting that the parameter is greater than or less than the null value in a specific direction)
