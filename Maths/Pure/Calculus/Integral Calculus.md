# What is it?  
  
Integral [[./index|calculus]] is the direct antitheses of [[./Differentiable Calculus|differentiable calculus]], with it providing both the anti-derivative and the indefinite integral. It is defined as the accumulation of change, which is a useful definition as it aids in the description that the integral is the area underneath a curve.   
  
# Flavours   
  
Integrals come in two flavours, the [[./Indefinite Integration|Indefinite Integral]] and the [[./Definite Integration|Definite integral]]. This is an important distinction as they both function differently with different use cases. The indefinite integral functions as the anti-derivative to a given function; whereas the definite integral is used to find the accumulation of change between a given range of values.   
  
One important distinction that must be made is that the antiderivative requires a constant term in addition to being integrated; this is as a result of the loss of the constant term when a function is differentiated, see [[./Power Rule|Power Rule]].
