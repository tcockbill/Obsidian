# What is calculus?  
  
Calculus is the study of continuous change; in common view it is divided into two elements, the [[./Integral Calculus|Integral]] and the [[./Differentiable Calculus|Derivative]].  Calculus is commonly tied into fields such as physics, and is one of the main basis for the [[../../../Physics/SUVAT|SUVAT]] equations discovered by newton.   
  
# What is a derivative?   
  
The derivative is a secondary function tied to another function, its differing trait from prementioned function is that it returns the gradient of the original function when an $x$ value is given.  See [[./Differentiable Calculus|differentiable calculus]].  
  
The main ways of signifying a derivative are Leibniz and Lagrangian notation, shown below.   
  
## Notation  
 Let $f(x)$ be a function that is continuously differentiable at any given point $a$.   
$\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] = f'(x) = \dot{f}$  
Albeit double dot notation is usually reserved for derivatives with respect to *time*.  
  
# What is an integral  
  
There are two flavours of integral, the [[./Indefinite Integration|Indefinite]] and the [[./Definite Integration|Definite Integral]], both of these tie in nicely with mechanics and pure maths; with both being in some form, a way of measuring the accumulation of change a function experiences. Indefinite integrals can be used to reverse differentiation, earning them the pseudonym of "Anti-Derivative"; whereas definite integrals are used to find the accumulation a function experiences. One example of this is the area present underneath a graph.
