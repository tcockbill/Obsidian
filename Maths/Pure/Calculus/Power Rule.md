# What is power rule?  
  
The Power Rule for differentiation is as follows,  
$$  
\frac{d}{dx}[ax^{b}] = abx^{(b-1)}  
$$  
The proof for this formula can be a bit convoluted at times; yet mainly consists of the [[../../Statistics/Binomial Expansion|Binomial Expansion]] and First Principles.  Additionally as a result of how the power rule functions, constant terms are from the equation that is differentiated, $3x^{0} = 3 \implies \frac{d}{dx}3 = 0$.
