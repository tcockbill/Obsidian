The **Log Rule** is a fundamental rule in calculus used to find the antiderivative (indefinite integral) of the function  1/x.  It states:  
  
∫ (1/x) dx = ln|x| + C  
  
Where:  
  
*   ∫ denotes the integral symbol.  
*   1/x is the function being integrated.  
*   ln|x| represents the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x.  
*   C is the constant of integration.  
  
**Explanation:**  
  
*   **Why the absolute value?** The natural logarithm function, ln(x), is only defined for positive values of x.  By taking the absolute value, ln|x|, we ensure that the antiderivative is valid for both positive and negative values of x.  
  
*   **Why the constant of integration?**  The derivative of a constant is always zero. Therefore, when finding an indefinite integral, we must include the constant of integration, C, to account for any possible constant term in the original function.  
  
**Examples:**  
  
*   ∫ (3/x) dx = 3 * ∫ (1/x) dx = 3ln|x| + C  
  
*   ∫ (1/(2x)) dx = (1/2) * ∫ (1/x) dx = (1/2)ln|x| + C  
  
**Importance:**  
  
The Log Rule is crucial because:  
  
*   It provides the antiderivative for a very common function, 1/x, which appears frequently in various mathematical and scientific applications.  
*   It serves as a building block for integrating more complex functions. Often, algebraic manipulation or substitution techniques transform integrals into forms that can be solved using the Log Rule.  
*   It's essential for understanding exponential growth and decay models, which are fundamental in fields like physics, biology, and finance.  
  
**Common Mistakes:**  
  
*   Forgetting the absolute value within the logarithm: `ln(x)` instead of `ln|x|`.  This is only valid for positive x.  
*   Forgetting the constant of integration, C. This is a critical error in indefinite integration.  
*   Incorrectly applying the Log Rule to functions that are not in the form 1/x (or easily transformable into that form).  
  
**Related Integration Techniques:**  
  
*   **Substitution (u-substitution):**  Often used in conjunction with the Log Rule.  
*   **[[./Integration by parts|Integration by Parts]]:**  A different technique used for integrating products of functions.  
*   **Partial Fraction Decomposition:** Used to break down rational functions into simpler terms, often leading to integrals solvable by the Log Rule.
