# What is a derivative?  
  
A derivative is defined as the rate of change of mathematical function, it could be [[../../../To do/Displacement|Displacement]], Velocity, or just plain $y$  units. Fundamentally, it relies on the principal that gradient, $m$ equals $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$.  
  
Lets start by defining our function, $f(x)$. And let $f'(x)$ be the gradient function of $f(x)$. Following this we can state that $\lim_{\Delta \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = f'(x)$. This forms the basis of First Principle differentiation, and many of the proofs for differentiation rules.   
  
Fundamentally, differentiation is the opposite to *[[./Indefinite Integration|indefinite integration]]*, or the anti-derivative. Additionally, both fall under the umbrella of [[./index|calculus]].
