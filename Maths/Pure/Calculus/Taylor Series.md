# What is it?  
A Taylor Series, or Taylor Expansion, is an infinite series; used to represent a function continuously [[./Differentiable Calculus|differentiable]] at any point $a$, as opposed to a [[./MacLaurin Series|MacLaurin Series]], which functions only at 0.  
  
 As a result they both appear pretty different, with the Taylor Series being defined as:   
 $$  
T(x) = \sum\limits^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{{f^{(n)}(a)}}{n!} \cdot (x-a)^n  
$$  
# Restrictions  
  
Taylor Series only function when the function $f(x)$ is infinitely differentiable at the point $a$, otherwise it cannot be reconstructed.
