# What is Indefinite Integration ?  
  
Indefinite integration is the logical inverse to [[./Differentiable Calculus|differentiable calculus]]; with it being used to calculate the antiderivative of a function.   
  
## Indefinite Integration  
  
**Definition:** The indefinite integral of a function *f(x)*, denoted by ∫ *f(x)* dx, is the most general function *F(x)* whose derivative is *f(x)*.  In other words:  
  
If d/dx *F(x)* = *f(x)*, then ∫ *f(x)* dx = *F(x)* + C, where C is an arbitrary constant of integration.  
  
**Key Concepts:**  
  
*   **Antiderivative:** *F(x)* is called the antiderivative of *f(x)*.  
*   **Constant of Integration (C):**  The "+ C" is crucial. Because the derivative of a constant is zero, there are infinitely many possible antiderivatives for any given function, differing only by a constant.  This constant represents the family of possible antiderivatives.  
*   **Linearity:** Integration is a linear operator:  
    *   ∫ [ *f(x)* + *g(x)* ] dx = ∫ *f(x)* dx + ∫ *g(x)* dx  
    *   ∫ k *f(x)* dx = k ∫ *f(x)* dx, where k is a constant.  
  
**Basic Integration Rules:**  
  
| Function *f(x)*          | Indefinite Integral ∫ *f(x)* dx   |  
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |  
| *x<sup>n</sup>* (n ≠ -1) | ( *x<sup>n+1</sup>* ) / (n+1) + C |  
| 1/x                      | ln                                |
