# What is the complex plane?  
  
The complex plane is a plan on which [[./index|complex numbers]] can be plotted, the $y$ axis of the plane is referred too as the imaginary axis and appears as a rotation of the real number line by 90 [[../../../To do/Degrees|degrees]].

# Explained  
  
The circle centred around the origin is the unit circle, all points along it are equidistant from the origin and have a modulus of 1; see [[./Polar Form|polar form]] and [[./Euler's Formula|Euler's formula]].
