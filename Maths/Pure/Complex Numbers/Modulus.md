# Modulus  
  
The modulus of a [[./index|Complex Numbers]] is defined as the absolute distance between a complex number and the origin, this is accomplished through the Pythagorean Theorem. It can be stated that $|z|^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}$ for a [[./index|complex number]] $z = a+bi$.  
  
# Uses  
  
The modulus function is most commonly used in the representation of [[./index|complex numbers]] in [[./Polar Form|polar form]].
