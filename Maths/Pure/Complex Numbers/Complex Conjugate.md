# The Conjugate  
  
The complex conjugate can be described as the [[../../../To do/Reflection|reflection]] of a complex number over the real axis, or $z* = a - bi$, where $z=a+bi$  
  
The conjugate was discovered as a result of the Quadratic Formula, where as a result of the $\pm \Delta$, present in the formula; the need for the complex conjugate was realised.  With both the complex number, and its conjugate being solutions to a given quadratic.  
  
# Interesting properties  
  
When a given [[./index|Complex Number]] is multiplied by its complex conjugate, the resulting real number, as it will always be real, is equal to the [[./Modulus|Modulus]] of said complex number, squared; or $z \cdot z* = a^{2}+ b^{2}  = |z|^2$.  
  
This can also be observed when put into [[./Polar Form|polar form]]  
  
$$z = |z|e^{i\arg{z}}, z* = |z|e^{-i\arg{z}}, \implies z \cdot z* = |z|^2$$  
>[!example] Example 1  
>If the conjugate of a complex number is $-5+6i$, what is the complex number?  
>$z* = -5+6i$  
>$z*=a-bi$  
>$z=a+bi$  
>The complex number is $-5-6i$  
  
>[!example] Example 2  
>A complex number has a modulus of 10 and an angle above the positive horizontal of $23.58\degree$, what is the complex number?  
>  
>The modulus = 10, so $a^2+b^2$ must equal $10^2$  
>Or we use trig to identify the two side lengths  
>So the real part must equal $10\sin23.58 = 4$  
>The complex part must equal $10\cos23.58 = 6$  
>So the complex number is $4+6i$   
  
>[!danger] Danger  
> Remember that when finding the conjugate of a complex number, only the sign on the imaginary part gets flipped as it is a reflection in the x axis, not in both the x and y axis
