# [[Polar Form|Polar Form]]   
  
[[Polar Form|Polar Form]] is a way of representing [[./index|complex numbers]] on the [[./Complex Plane|complex plane]]; this method utilises **[[./Euler's Formula|Euler's formula]]** in order to represent said numbers; with any given complex number consisting of two arguments: the numbers magnitude, and its phase.   
  
The phase of a complex number is known as its angle from the positive horizontal real axis, or known as, $\arctan{(\frac{a}{b}})$. The magnitude of a [[Polar Form|Polar Form]] number is the coefficient of $we^{\theta i }$, or the points distance from the origin. See [[./Modulus|modulus]].
