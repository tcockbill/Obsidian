# What is it?   
  
Euler's formula, $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$, commonly referred too as the *"Most Beautiful Equation In Maths"*, was discovered by Leonard Euler in the early 1700s. It has been adapted over the years into the more descriptive:   
$$e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta$$  
Where $\theta$ is an angle in [[../../../To do/Radians|radians]].   
  
# Derivation of the Formula  
  
The formula has many ways to be derived, but the most common stems from the substitution of $ix$ into the [[../Calculus/MacLaurin Series|MacLaurin series]] of $e^x$.  Which coincidentally, results in $\cos \theta + i \sin \theta$.   
  
$$  
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}x^n  
$$  
  
# Uses  
  
As a result of no real coefficient acting on the $e^{i\theta}$, the absolute distance between the complex point and the origin will **ALWAYS** be $1$. This begets the definition of the unit circle.   
  
When a coefficient is given to a number in [[./Polar Form|polar form]], that functions as the scalar that multiplies the magnitude of the [[../../../To do/Displacement|displacement]] from the origin. For instance:  
  
``` tikz  
\usepackage{amsfonts}  
\begin{document}  
\begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:4]  
\draw[thin,color=gray] (0,0) grid (6,6);  
\draw[<->, color=gray] (0,3) -- (6,3);  
\draw[<->, color=gray] (3,0) -- (3,6);  
\draw (3,3) circle (1);  
  
\node[anchor=west] at (6,3) {$+\mathbb{R}$};  
\node[anchor=east] at (0,3) {$-\mathbb{R}$};  
\node[anchor=south] at (3,6) {$+\mathbb{I}$};  
\node[anchor=north] at (3,0) {$-\mathbb{I}$};  
  
\node[anchor=south west] at (3.717, 3.717) {$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i$};  
\filldraw (3.717, 3.717) circle (0.1);  
  
\draw (3.717, 3.717) -- (3,3);  
  
\end{tikzpicture}  
\end{document}  
```  
As seen above, the point lies on the Unit Circle, giving it a [[./Modulus|modulus]] of one; the argument of the number, or its phase; can be found form the equation $\theta = \arctan ( \frac{\Im}{\Re})$.
