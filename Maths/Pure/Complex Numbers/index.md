# Complex Numbers  
  
Complex numbers are defined as having both a real part, commonly denoted as $\Re$, as well as an "imaginary" part; denoted by $\Im$. Akin to how $x$ is used inside real mathematics; complex numbers and the fields that involve them commonly use $z,w$ as their variables.   
  
# Definition  
  
Complex numbers, in practice, are an extension of the real numbers, clearly showed when plotted on the [[./Complex Plane|complex plane]]. The distinguishing feature between complex numbers and real numbers is the inclusion of the imaginary unit, $i$. Which in turn is defined as $i^{2} = -1$, or $i = \sqrt{-1}$. Leading to one form of complex numbers appearing in the form $z=a+bi$.
