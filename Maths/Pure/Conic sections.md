# Conic sections  
These are a special category of curve. They are formed by the intersection of a plane and a cone.  
Another type of conic section is an ellipse. The ellipse is formed by the intersection of a cone and a plane that cuts through only the curved surface of the cone.  
  
Equations in the formula $xy=c^2$ describes a rectangular hyperbola centred on the origin with asymptotes $y=0$ and $x=0$
