# Starter  
If $a<b$, is $a^2<b^2$? Explain your answer  
$a=2 \qquad b=3$  
$2<3 \space and \space 2^2<3^2$  
but if $a=-2 \qquad b=-1$  
$a<b \space but \space a^2>b^2$  
  
# Notes  
The rules for solving inequalities are very similar to those for solving equations, but there are two differences  
- Answers to inequalities are a range of values rather than individual values  
- When you multiply or divide my a negative number, you reverse the inequality sign  
  
Solve the inequality $$ \frac{18x-135}{x-3} \le 21$$  
Multiply by $(x-3)^2$  
$(18x-135) (x-3) \le 21(x-3)^2$  
$18x^2-189x+405 \le 21x^2-126x+189$  
$0 \le 3x^2 + 63x -216$  
$0 \le x^2 +21x - 72$  
$0 \le (x+24)(x-3)$  
$x \le -24 \qquad x \ge 3$  
  
$(x-3)(x^2-x-12) \le 0$  
Graph = $x^3-4x^2-9x+36$  
$(x-3)(x-4)(x+3) \le 0$  
  
```desmos-graph  
x^3-4x^2-9x+36 <= 0  
```
