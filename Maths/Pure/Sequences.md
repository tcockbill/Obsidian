## Sequences  
  
A sequence is an ordered list of elements. These elements can be numbers, functions, strings, or anything else. Key characteristics of sequences include:  
  
*   **Order Matters:** The position of an element in the sequence is significant. Changing the order creates a different sequence.  
*   **Elements can Repeat:** A single value can appear multiple times within a sequence.  
*   **Can be Finite or Infinite:** A sequence can have a fixed, limited number of elements (finite) or continue indefinitely (infinite).  
  
### Types of Sequences  
  
*   **Arithmetic Sequence:** Each term is obtained by adding a constant value (the common difference) to the preceding term.  Example: 2, 4, 6, 8, ... (common difference is 2)  
*   **Geometric Sequence:** Each term is obtained by multiplying the preceding term by a constant value (the common ratio). Example: 1, 3, 9, 27, ... (common ratio is 3)  
*   **Fibonacci Sequence:** Each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...  
*   **Harmonic Sequence:** The reciprocals of the terms form an arithmetic sequence. Example: 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...  
*   **General Sequence:**  A sequence that doesn't necessarily follow a specific rule like arithmetic or geometric sequences.  
  
### Representation of Sequences  
  
*   **Listing:**  Simply writing out the elements (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16, ...)  
*   **Explicit Formula:** Defining a formula that gives the nth term of the sequence directly based on its position 'n'.  Example: a_n = n^2  
*   **Recursive Formula:** Defining a formula that gives the nth term based on the value of preceding terms. Example:  a_1 = 1, a_n = a_{n-1} + 2  (an arithmetic sequence)  
  
### Examples  
  
*   **Sequence of even numbers:** 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,... (Arithmetic, Explicit: a_n = 2n)  
*   **Sequence of squares:** 1, 4, 9, 16, 25,... (Explicit: a_n = n^2)  
*   **A sequence of letters:** A, B, C, A, B, C, A, B, C,... (General, repeating)  
  
### Use Cases  
  
Sequences are fundamental in various areas of mathematics and computer science, including:  
  
*   **Calculus:** Limits, series, and convergence.  
*   **Discrete Mathematics:**  Recurrence relations, combinatorics.  
*   **Computer Science:**  Arrays, linked lists, algorithms.  
*   **Financial Modeling:**  Analyzing investment returns, predicting market trends.  
  
### Related Concepts  
  
*   **Series:** The sum of the terms in a sequence.  
*   **Limits:** The value that the terms of a sequence approach as n approaches infinity.  
*   **Functions:**  A sequence can be considered a function where the domain is the set of natural numbers.
