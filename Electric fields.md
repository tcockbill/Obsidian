# Electric charge  
  
## Charging by induction  
Negatively charged rod repels free electons and pushes them away  
  
## Conductors and insulators  
Conductors - Materials with many free electrons, which can easily flow  
Insulators - Materials that have very few free electrons and cannot easily flow  
Semi-conductors - Materials that will insulate whe pure but will conduct when an impurity is added  
  
## Unit of charge  
- Charge is measured in *Coulombs, C*.  
- It has the symbol $Q$  
- It is a scalar quantity  
- The Coulomb is defined as the charge transported by one ampere in one second  
$$\Delta Q = I \Delta t$$  
  
## Law of conservation  
In a closed system, the amount of charge is always conserved  
  
## Charging by friction  
An insulator can become charged when rubbed. The frictional forces between the cloth and the rod removes electrons from the cloth and deposits them on the rod

# Electric Fields  
When charges are in the vicinity of each other, they experience a force at a distance  
This is due to the electric fields that surround all charges  
  
An electric field is defined as a region of space where a charges object experiences an electric forces. This force can be attractive or repulsive, and its direction is indicated by electric field lines  
  
The arrow on the field line shows the direction of the electric field.  
The direction of the field is taken to be the direction of the force it would exert a positive test charge  
  
The closeness of the field lines shows the strength of the electric field  
The closer together the lines are, the stronger the field  
  
## Drawing radial fields  
The field lines extend around the charge and are drawn at right angles to the surface of the charge  
Electric fields go from positive to negative.  
***FIELD LINES SHOULD NEVER CROSS***  
  
## Drawing uniform fields  
Edge effect - where the lines curve at the edges of the parallel plates  
Uniform field - shown by the field lines being parallel and equidistant  
- Lines leave surface at right angles  
- Direction of field os that a positive test charge would travel  
- The closer the lines, the stronger the field  
  
## Electric field strength  
The electric field strength, E, is defined as the force per unit positive test charge, q.  
It is a vector  
It has units $NC^{-1}$  
$$E=\frac{F}{q}$$  
  
## Coulombs equation  
$$F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon _0} \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$  
<center>OR</center>  
$$F=k\frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$$  
<center>Where</center>  
$$k=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}$$  
  
## Radial field strength  
$$E=\frac{F}{q}=k\frac{qQ_1}{r^2q}$$  
$$E=k\frac{Q_1}{r^2}$$  
  
## Uniform field strength  
$$E=\frac{F}{q}=\frac{Vq}{dq}$$  
$$E=\frac{V}{d}$$  
E also has units of $Vm^{-1}$  
V = potential difference across parallel plates  
d = distance between plates

# Coulomb's law  
Electrostatic force - the interfaction between two electrically charged particles is due to the electrostatic force between them  
>[!formula] Coulomb's Law  
>$$\huge{F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon _0} \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2}}$$  
>- The electrostatic force is a vector and is measured in newtons  
>- The relationship between force, F, and distance, r, and is an inverse-squared relationship  
>- The constant, $\epsilon_0$, is the permittivity of free-space and is constant in a vacuum  
>- This law only works for point charges with radial electric fields  
  
- The permittivity of free space $\epsilon_0$, tells us how strongly the electric field reacts to the presence of charges in empty space  
  
# Force in a uniform field  
If a point travels between two parallel electrodes with a potential difference across them, it will experience an electrostatic force  
  
>[!formula] Force in a uniform field  
>$$\huge{F=\frac{VQ}{d} \quad \text{OR} \quad F=EQ}$$  
>  
>The magnitude of electrostatic force, F, will depend on:  
>1. The potential difference, V.  
>2. The distance between the electrodes, d.  
>3. The size of the charge, Q.
