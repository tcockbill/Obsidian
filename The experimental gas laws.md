# The experimental gas laws  
  
## Brownian motion and gas laws  
- The particles in a fluid are always moving and their motion is random  
- This motion causes pressure when the particles collide with surfaces (and each other)  
- This motion is also responsible for diffusion of mixtures in fluids  
  
  
## Charles' law  
  
>[!formula]  
>$$V \propto T$$  
>$$\frac{V}{T} \propto I$$  
>$$\frac{V}{T} \text{constant}$$  
  
## Boyle's law  
  
>[!formula]  
>$$p \propto \frac{I}{V}$$  
>$$pV \propto I$$  
>$$pV = \text{constant}$$  
  
## Pressure law  
  
>[!formula]  
>$$p\propto T$$  
>$$\frac{p}{T} \propto I$$  
>$$\frac{p}{T} = \text{constant}$$  
>$$\frac{p_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2}{T_2}$$  
  
Isobaric = constant pressure  
Isothermal = constant temperature
