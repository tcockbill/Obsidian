# Finding Probability  
$$\text{The probability of an outcome} = \frac{\text{the number of ways the outcome can happen}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}$$  
Think about a fair ordinary dice. To find the probability of rolling a 4, take the number of possible ways of rolling a 4 and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.  
  
There is one way of rolling a 4 and there are six possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling a 4 on a dice is $\frac{1}{6}$. This is called the ‘theoretical probability’ - in theory, if you roll a dice six times then you should roll a 4 once.  
  
To find the probability of rolling an odd number on a dice, take the number of ways of getting an odd number which is 3 (1, 3 and 5), and divide by the total number of possible outcomes:  
$\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$  
  
## Question  
What is the probability of selecting a vowel at random from the word PROBABILITY?  
### Answer  
$\text{Number of vowels} = 4$  
$\text{Number of letters in total} = 11$  
$\text{Therefore, the probability} = \frac{4}{11}$  
  
  
  
  
# Probability of events not happening  
Events that cannot happen at the same time are **mutually exclusive** events. For example, a football team can win, lose or draw, but these events cannot happen at the same time, so these events are mutually exclusive. Since it is certain that one of these outcomes will happen, their probabilities must add up to 1.   
  
The probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of the event happening.  
  
## Example  
A bag contains 12 counters of different colours: 5 red, 4 white and 3 black. Find the probability of **not** selecting a red counter.  
  
The probability of selecting a red counter is $\frac{5}{12}$, so the probability of not selecting a red counter is $1−\frac{5}{12}$ which is $\frac{12}{12}−\frac{5}{12}=\frac{7}{12}$.  
  
## Question  
A spinner has four sections numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4. The probabilities of the spinner landing on a number are listed below. Find the probability $(p)$ of the spinner landing on a 4.  
  
| Number on spinner | 1   | 2   | 3    | 4   |  
| ----------------- | --- | --- | ---- | --- |  
| Probability       | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.12 | $p$ |  
### Answer  
The probabilities must add to 1, to get the probability of the spinner landing on a 4, we do the 1 minus the sum of the known probabilities  
$1-(0.5+0.2+0.12)=p$  
$1-0.82=p$  
$p=0.18$  
  
  
## Question  
If the same spinner was spun 50 times, how many times would you expect it to land on the number 2?  
  
### Answer  
Since the probability of the spinner landing on a 2 is 0.2, the number of 2s expected from 50 spins would be $50 \times 0.2 =10$
