# Orders  
Changing the concentration of a reactant often changes the [[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]]  
$$ \huge{\text{rate} \propto [A]^n}$$  
Rate is proportional to the concentration of a reactant raised to a particular power  
Overall order - sum of the orders with respect to each reactant  
  
## Zero order  
- $\text{rate} \propto [A]^0$  
- Concentration has no affect on the [[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]]  
- (anything to the power of 0 = 1)  
  
## First order  
- $\text{rate} \propto [A]^1$  
- Any change in concentration gives the same change in the rate  
	- If concentration of A is doubled, the rate also doubles  
	- $[A] \times 2 \rightarrow 2^1 = 2 \times \text{ the rate}$  
  
## Second order  
- $\text{rate} \propto [A]^2$  
- Any change in concentration changes the rate  by the square of the change  
	- If concentration of A is triple, the rate increases x9  
	- $[A] \times 3 \rightarrow 3^2 = 9 \times \text{ the rate}$  
  
Orders must be determined experimentally - they cannot be found from chemical equations  
  
# Rate equation  
A **rate equation** mathematically expresses the influence each reactant has on the [[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]]   
$$\text{for "} A+B+C \rightarrow \text{ products"}, \text{rate} \propto [A]^x[B]^y[C]^z$$  
$$ \text{rate} = k[A]^x[B]^y[C]^z$$  
- Remove any reactants with 0 order as they do not influence the rate  
- Remove the 1<sup>st</sup> but keep the reactants  
  
# Calculating the rate constant  
To determine the rate constant (and its units):  
  
1. Substitute the relevant values/units into the rate equation  
2. Rearrange the equation to give "k"  
3. Complete the maths and cancel out any common units, presenting the final units on a single line
