Carried on from [[./Periodicity|Periodicity]]  
# Metals and non-metals  
Across a [[../../To do/Period|period]], elements change from metals to non-metals.  
**Metalloids/semi-metals ->** elements found along the divide, with both metal and non-metal properties  
  
# Metallic bonding  
Bonding found within metals (not between)  
**Metallic bond ->** strong electrostatic attraction between positive metal ions (cations) and delocalised electrons  
Forms a **giant metallic lattice**  
  
# Properties of metals  
**-> High melting point** - lots of energy needed to overcome the strong electrostatic attraction between the cations and delocalised electrons  
	- Exeptions are mercurey (liquid at RT) and group 1 metals  
	- The greater the [[../../To do/Charge|charge]] on the cation, the more delocalised electrons there are and the higher the melting point  
**-> Good conductors** - delocalised electrons are free to move and carry [[../../To do/Charge|charge]] through the structure  
	- _ALL_ metals conduct, not just transition metals  
**-> Insoluble** - Metals do not dissolve in water  
	- They can react with water (E.g. Group 1 metals), but this is not the same as dissolving  
  
  
# Properties of diamond and silicon dioxide  
**-> High melting point** - lots of strong [[../../To do/Covalent bonds|covalent bonds]] that need a lot of energy to break apart the lattice  
**-> Do not conduct** - all 4 outer electrons are involved in bonding, meaning there are no free electrons to move and carry [[../../To do/Charge|charge]]  
**-> Insoluble** - The lattice of covalenjt bonds is too strong to be broken by interactions with solvents  
  
# Graphite and graphene  
**Graphite** - Hexagonal structure with weak [[../Definitions/London forces|London forces]] between layers - trigonal planar, 120$\textdegree$  
**Graphene** - One layer of graphite, which is only one carbon atom thick  
  
## Properties  
**-> High melting point** - Lots of strong [[../../To do/Covalent bonds|covalent bonds]] that need a lot of energy to break apart the lattice  
**-> Good conductors** - Only 3 of 4 of the carbons outer electrons are used for covalent bonding, leaving one [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] from each carbon atom to become delocalised  
	- Graphene has the same conductivity as copper  
**-> Insoluble** - The lattice of [[../../To do/Covalent bonds|covalent bonds]] is too strong to be broken by interactions with solvents.  
  
# Trends in melting points  
Across Periods 2 and 3, the melting point:  
-> Increases from group 1 -> group 4  
	- Metallic bonding to giant covalent  
-> Decreases sharply in group 5 and stays low  
	- Simple covalent molecules with weak [[../Definitions/London forces|London forces]]
