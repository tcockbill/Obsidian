# <u><b>Catalysts</b></u>  
A substance that increases the [[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]] without being used up  
A catalyst finds and alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, meaning more particles have the necessary energy to react  
## <u>Types of catalyst</u>  
<b>Homogeneous</b> — The catalyst is in the same physical state as the reactants  
1. Catalysts reacts with the reactants to form and intermediate  
2. The intermediate breaks down to give the product and regenerates the catalyst  
  
$2O_3(g) \overset{Cl\bullet(g)}{\leftrightharpoons} 3O_2(g)$  
  
<b>Heterogeneous</b> — the catalyst is in a <u>different</u> physical state to the reactants (usually a solid)  
1. Reactant molecules are adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst, where the reaction takes place  
2. After the reaction, the product molecules leave the surface of the catalyst by desorption  
  
$N_2(g)+3H_2(g) \overset{Fe(s)}{\leftrightharpoons} 2NH_3(g)$  
  
## <u>Importance of catalysts</u>  
Catalysts are often used in industry  
  
Lower activation energy → lower temperature needed → less energy required → Less electricity or fossil fuels needed → less $CO_2$ released  
  
<u>Overall</u> — When using a catalyst, the product is made faster and using less energy, making it more economical and releasing less greenhouse gases  
  
# <b><u>Questions</u></b>  
**Q1.** Hydrogen peroxide solution decomposes slowly to form water and oxygen. The reaction is much faster in the presence of a manganese(IV) oxide catalyst.  
2H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(aq) → 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)  
Three experiments, shown in the table, were carried out to investigate how the volume of oxygen produced varied over time under different conditions. The same mass of catalyst was used in each experiment.  
  
| **Experiment** | **Concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(aq) / mol dm<sup>–3</sup>** | **Volume of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(aq) / cm<sup>3</sup>** | **Temperature / °C** | **Catalyst** |  
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |  
| **1**          | 1.0                                                                       | 50                                                            | 20                   | lumps        |  
| **2**          | 1.0                                                                       | 50                                                            | 20                   | powder       |  
| **3**          | 0.5                                                                       | 50                                                            | 20                   | lumps        |  
The graph shows how the volume of oxygen collected varied with time in Experiment **1**.

(a) Explain, in general terms, how a catalyst increases the rate of a reaction.  
  
The catalyst finds an alternative pathway that has a lower activation energy than without the catalyst, so there are more particles colliding with sufficient energy to react.  
  
(b) Draw **two** lines on the graph to show how the volume of oxygen collected varied with time in Experiments **2** and **3**.  
  
The line would be steeper for reaction 2 than reaction 1, and finish earlier, but still at the same level of oxygen  
The line would be shallower for reaction 3 than reaction 1, and finish later, and half the height  
  
(c) Explain, in terms of collision theory, the effect of increasing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide on the [[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]].  
  
If you increase the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and keep the volume the same, there will be more hydrogen peroxide particles in the volume, increasing the number of total collisions, while the ratio of successful collisions remain the same, so the number of successful collisions increases.  
  
**Q2.**   
The gas-phase reaction between hydrogen and chlorine is very slow at room temperature.  
H₂(g) + Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2HCl(g)  
  
(a) Define the term _activation energy_.  
Activation energy is the minimum energy required for a successful collision to occur.  
  
(b) Give **one** reason why the reaction between hydrogen and chlorine is very slow at room temperature.  
Most of the particles do not have enough energy to collide with the activation energy for the reaction.
