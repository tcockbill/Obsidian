## Effect on temperature  
Higher temperatures mean particles have more energy  
More successful collisions as more molecules achieve the activation energy​  
More frequent collisions as molecules are moving faster (less important)

## Effect of catalyst  
Catalyst – Finds an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy  
More particles have the required activation energy, meaning more successful collisions

As you increase the temperature, you increase the proportion of molecules that have the activation of the energy, increasing the [[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]] as there are more particles with the activation energy

The catalyst lowers the activation energy by finding an alternative pathway that requires less energy, so there is a higher proportion of particles equal to or above the activation energy
