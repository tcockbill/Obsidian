i. $Sr(s)+2H_2O(l)$->$Sr(OH)_2(aq)+H_2(g)$  
ii. 0.2/87.62=0.00228  
0.00228/0.25= 0.00912$mol\space{dm}^{-3}$

The volume of Hydrogen gas produced would increase as the [[../../To do/Mass|mass]] of calcium per mole is less than strontium, so there would be more moles of calcium, so there would be more moles of hydrogen produced.  
$n(Ca)=0.200/40.1=0.005mol$
