# Boltzmann distribution  
Higher temperature = faster rate as:  
- Particles have more energy so collide more frequently  
- More particles exceed the necessary activation  
A higher temperature also increases the rate constant $k$  
- while many factors affect the *[[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]]*, only <u>temperature</u> affects the rate constant  
## Calculating k  
So far:  
- Rearranging rate = $k[A]$  
- Using $k=\frac{\ln 2}{t_{\frac{1}{1}}}$  
Arrhenius equation - Mathematically describes the exponential relationship between temperature, activation energy, and the rate constant  
  
## Factors affecting rate  
$k=Ae^{-E_a/RT}$  
  
### Activation energy (Ea)  
- Higher $E_a$ = lower k  
- Fewer molecules have enough energy to react, so the rate will be slower  
  
### Temperature (T)  
- Higher temperature = higher k  
- Molecules have more energy so collide more frequently, but more importantly more molecules exceed the activation energy  
  
### Frequency factor (A)  
- Higher A = higher k  
- More collisions are happening with the correct orientation  
  
$\ln k = \ln A - \frac{E_a}{R} \times \frac{1}{T}$  
$y=mx+c$  
$y \text{ intercept } = \ln A$
