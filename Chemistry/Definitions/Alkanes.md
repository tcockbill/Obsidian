# Alkanes  
Alkanes are saturated [[./Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbons]]  
This means that they only consist of single bonds and of only hydrogen and carbon atoms  
They have the suffix -ane  
They have the general formula C$_n$H$_{2n+2}$  
The first 4 alkanes are:  
  
| Name    | Formula       |  
| ------- | ------------- |  
| Methane | CH$_4$        |  
| Ethane  | C$_2$H$_6$    |  
| Propane | C$_3$H$_8$    |  
| Butane  | C$_4$H$_{10}$ |  
  
# Skeletal Formula  
Skeletal formulas show the general shape of the molecule without having the clutter of all the CH$_2$ and CH$_3$ everywhere  
For example:  
C$_3$H$_8$   
```smiles  
CCC  
```  
  
  
  
```smiles  
C(C)=C(Cl)(Cl)  
C(C)(Cl)=C(Cl)  
C(C(Cl))=C(Cl)  
C(C(Cl)(Cl))=C  
C(Cl)(C(Cl))=C  
```

```smiles
