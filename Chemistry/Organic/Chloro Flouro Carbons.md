# <b>CFC's and associated problems</b>  
These are [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]] which are fully substituted by various combinations of chlorine and fluorine  
e.g. $CF_2Cl_2, CFCl_2, CClF_2CClF_2$  
  
In the stratosphere, ozone is constantly being formed from oxygen and broken up again  
They should be in [[../Miss Eggleton/Equilibrium|equilibrium]] with the concentration of ozone approximately constant  
  
This steady state is created as follows:  
$O_2+ uv \rightarrow \bullet O \bullet + \bullet O \bullet$  
$O_2+\bullet O \bullet \rightarrow O_3$  
$O_3+uv \rightarrow O_2 \bullet O \bullet$  
$O_3+\bullet O \bullet \rightarrow 2O_2$  
  
This formation and breaking up of ozone is going on all the time. Taken together, these reactions stop a lot of harmful UV radiation penetrating the atmosphere to reach the surface of the earth.  
  
The Ozone has been depleted by CFCs which have diffused into the stratosphere during the 20th century  
$CF_2Cl_2 + uv \rightarrow \bullet CF_2 Cl + Cl \bullet$  
  
These radicals act as homogeneous catalysts for ozone depletions  
$Cl \bullet + O_3 \rightarrow ClCO\bullet + O_2$  
$ClCO \bullet + O_3 \rightarrow Cl \bullet + 2O_2$
