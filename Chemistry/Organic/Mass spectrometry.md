## Mass Spectrometry  
  
**Definition:** An analytical technique used to identify and quantify different molecules within a sample by measuring their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).  
  
**Principles:**  
  
*   **Ionization:** The sample is ionized, creating charged molecules (ions). This can be achieved through various techniques like:  
    *   **Electron Ionization (EI):** Bombarding the sample with high-energy electrons.  Often results in fragmentation.  
    *   **Chemical Ionization (CI):** Reacting the sample with ionized reagent gas (e.g., methane or ammonia). Softer ionization, less fragmentation.  
    *   **Electrospray Ionization (ESI):**  Spraying a liquid sample through a charged needle.  Popular for large biomolecules like proteins.  
    *   **Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI):**  Sample embedded in a matrix is irradiated with a laser, causing ionization.  Also good for large biomolecules.

| How is it done  | High energy electrons (from an "electron gun" are fired at the samples)                                       | The compound is dissolved in a volatile solvent and sprayed out into a fine mist via a hypodermic needle whose tip is connected to the positive terminal of a high voltage power supply. |  
  
  
*   **Mass Analysis:**  Ions are separated based on their m/z ratio using a mass analyzer. Common types include:  
    *   **Quadrupole:** Uses oscillating electric fields to filter ions based on their m/z.  
    *   **Time-of-Flight (TOF):** Measures the time it takes for ions to travel a known distance. Lighter ions travel faster.  
    *   **Ion Trap:** Traps ions using electric or magnetic fields.  
    *   **Orbitrap:** Measures the frequency of ion oscillation in a magnetic field. Very high resolution.  
  
*   **Detection:**  Ions are detected, and their abundance is measured.  This data is used to generate a mass spectrum, which plots ion abundance versus m/z.  
  
**Components of a Mass Spectrometer:**  
  
1.  **Sample Inlet:** Introduces the sample into the instrument.  
2.  **Ion Source:** Ionizes the sample.  
3.  **Mass Analyzer:** Separates ions based on m/z.  
4.  **Detector:** Detects the ions and measures their abundance.  
5.  **Data System:** Processes and displays the data.  
  
**Applications:**  
  
*   **Identification of Unknown Compounds:** By matching the mass spectrum to known spectra or using fragmentation patterns to deduce the structure.  
*   **Quantification of Known Compounds:** Measuring the abundance of specific ions.  
*   **Protein Identification and Sequencing:**  Peptide mass fingerprinting, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).  
*   **Pharmaceutical Analysis:** Drug discovery, metabolism studies.  
*   **Environmental Monitoring:** Detection of pollutants.  
*   **Clinical Chemistry:** Diagnostic testing.  
*   **Food Safety:** Detection of contaminants.  
*   **Isotope Ratio Analysis:** Determining the isotopic composition of elements.  
  
**Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS):**  
  
*   Involves two mass analyzers in series.  
*   Used to fragment selected ions and analyze the fragments.  
*   Provides more detailed structural information.  
*   Commonly used for peptide sequencing.  
  
**Advantages:**  
  
*   High sensitivity  
*   High specificity  
*   Versatile - can be used to analyze a wide range of compounds  
  
**Disadvantages:**  
  
*   Can be expensive  
*   Requires skilled operators  
*   Sample preparation can be complex  
*   Fragmentation can complicate interpretation  
  
**Key Terms:**  
  
*   **Mass-to-charge ratio (m/z):**  The ratio of an ion's mass to its charge.  
*   **Base Peak:** The most abundant ion in the mass spectrum.  
*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The ion formed by the removal of one electron from the intact molecule (often seen in EI).  
*   **Fragment Ion:**  Ions formed by the fragmentation of the molecular ion.  
*   **Resolution:** A measure of the ability to distinguish between ions with similar m/z values.  High resolution instruments can separate ions with very small mass differences.  
*   **Isotopic Abundance:** The natural abundance of different isotopes of an element, which affects the peaks in the mass spectrum.

**Detection**  
  
Sample (M) into spectrometer

-> electron knocked off M  
-> Molecular ion radical (M+.)  
  
M(g) + e --> M+(g) + 2e  
  
Some molecular ion radicals fragment by covalent bonds breaking  
  
-> Free radical and a positive ion for each fragmentation  
  
Different bonds breaking in M+  
-> Different radicals and ions  
-> Mixture of M+ with various radicals and ions
