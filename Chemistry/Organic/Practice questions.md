# Practice questions  
1. A saturated [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|Hydrocarbon]] is a molecule thagt consists of only hydrogen and carbon atoms and only contains single bonds  
2.   
```smiles  
CCCCCCCC  
```  
This is octane  
```smiles  
CCC(C)C  
```  
this is 2-methylbutane  
```smiles  
CC(C)(C)CC  
```  
This is 2,2-dimethylbutane  
3. Hexane has a higher boiling point than 3-methylpentane as Hexane has a higher surface area of contact compared to the 3-methylpentane, therefore the [[../Definitions/London forces|London Forces]] are stronger in hexane, causing a higher boiling point  
  
	2-methyloctane has a higher boiling point than 3,3-dimethylheptane as 2-methyloctane has a higher surface area of contact compared to the 3,3-dimethylheptane, therefore the [[../Definitions/London forces|London Forces]] are stronger in 2-methyloctane, causing a higher boiling point  
  
	Hexane has a higher boiling point than Pentane as Hexane has a higher surface area of contact compared to the Pentane, therefore the [[../Definitions/London forces|London Forces]] are stronger in hexane, causing a higher boiling point  
  
5. [[./Reactions of Alkanes|Complete combustion]] -> C$_9$H$_{20}$+14O$_2$->10H$_2$O+9CO$_2$  
	[[./Reactions of Alkanes|Incomplete combustion]] ->  C$_9$H$_{20}$+9.5O$_2$->10H$_2$O+9CO
