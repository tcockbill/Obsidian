## Infra-red (IR) Spectroscopy  
  
**What it is:**  
  
*   A spectroscopic technique that identifies molecules based on their absorption of infrared radiation.  
*   IR radiation causes molecules to vibrate - bond stretching, bending, etc.  
*   Different functional groups absorb IR radiation at different frequencies, leading to a unique "fingerprint" for each molecule.  
  
**Principles:**  
  
*   **Molecular Vibrations:** Molecules vibrate at specific frequencies dependent on bond strength, atom masses, and molecular geometry.  
*   **Infrared Absorption:** When IR radiation matches the vibrational frequency of a bond, the molecule absorbs the energy. This absorption is detected and plotted on an IR spectrum.  
*   **Dipole Moment Change:**  For a molecule to absorb IR radiation, the vibration *must* cause a change in the molecule's dipole moment.  Symmetrical molecules (e.g., O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>) do *not* show an IR spectrum.  
*   **Wavenumber (cm<sup>-1</sup>):**  IR spectra are typically plotted as absorbance or transmittance versus wavenumber (ν̃), which is the reciprocal of the wavelength (λ) in centimeters (ν̃ = 1/λ).  Higher wavenumbers correspond to higher energy and frequency.  
  
**Instrumentation:**  
  
*   **IR Source:** Emits infrared radiation (e.g., Nernst glower, Globar, or diode lasers).  
*   **Interferometer (FTIR):** Used in Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers to create an interferogram, which contains all frequencies of the IR source. FTIR instruments are more sensitive and faster than dispersive instruments.  
*   **Sample Compartment:** Where the sample is placed.  Sample preparation depends on the physical state (solid, liquid, gas).  
*   **Detector:** Measures the amount of IR radiation that passes through the sample (e.g., deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) or mercury cadmium telluride (MCT)).  
*   **Data Processing & Output:**  The detector signal is processed by a computer, which performs a Fourier transform (in FTIR) to generate the IR spectrum.  
  
**Sample Preparation:**  
  
*   **Solids:**  
    *   **KBr Pellet:**  The solid sample is finely ground and mixed with potassium bromide (KBr), then pressed into a transparent pellet. KBr is used because it is transparent in the IR region.  
    *   **Nujol Mull:** The solid is ground and mixed with Nujol (mineral oil) to form a suspension, which is then placed between salt plates (NaCl or KBr).  
*   **Liquids:**  Placed between salt plates (NaCl or KBr).  
*   **Gases:**  Held in a gas cell with transparent windows.  
  
**Interpreting IR Spectra:**  
  
*   **Characteristic Absorptions:** Specific functional groups exhibit characteristic absorption bands (peaks) at specific wavenumber ranges.  
*   **Key Functional Groups and Wavenumber Ranges:**  
    *   **O-H Stretch:** 3200-3600 cm<sup>-1</sup> (broad, often strong) - Alcohols, carboxylic acids, water.  Carboxylic acids tend to be broader due to hydrogen bonding.  
    *   **N-H Stretch:** 3300-3500 cm<sup>-1</sup> (sharp) - Amines, amides.  
    *   **C-H Stretch:** 2850-3000 cm<sup>-1</sup> - [[../Definitions/Alkanes|Alkanes]], alkenes, aromatics.  
    *   **C=O Stretch:** 1650-1750 cm<sup>-1</sup> (strong) - Ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, [[./Esters|esters]], amides.  The exact position depends on the specific functional group.  
    *   **C=C Stretch:** 1600-1680 cm<sup>-1</sup> - Alkenes, aromatics.  
    *   **C≡C Stretch:** 2100-2260 cm<sup>-1</sup> - Alkynes.  
    *   **C≡N Stretch:** 2220-2260 cm<sup>-1</sup> - Nitriles.  
    *   **C-O Stretch:** 1000-1300 cm<sup>-1</sup> - Alcohols, ethers, [[./Esters|esters]], carboxylic acids.  
  
*   **Fingerprint Region:** The region below 1500 cm<sup>-1</sup> is often called the fingerprint region.  It contains a complex series of absorptions unique to each molecule. This region is more difficult to interpret than the higher wavenumber regions but is useful for comparing spectra and identifying specific compounds.  
*   **Peak Intensity and Shape:**  The intensity and shape of absorption bands can also provide information about the concentration and structure of the molecule.  
  
**Applications:**  
  
*   **Identification of Unknown Compounds:** By comparing the IR spectrum of an unknown compound to a database of known spectra.  
*   **Functional Group Analysis:**  Determining the presence or absence of specific functional groups in a molecule.  
*   **Monitoring Chemical Reactions:** Following the disappearance of reactants or the appearance of products during a chemical reaction.  
*   **Polymer Characterization:** Determining the composition and structure of polymers.  
*   **Environmental Monitoring:**  Detecting and quantifying pollutants in air and water.  
*   **Pharmaceutical Analysis:**  Quality control and identification of drug substances.  
  
**Advantages:**  
  
*   Relatively simple and fast technique.  
*   Can be used to analyze a wide variety of samples (solids, liquids, gases).  
*   Non-destructive.  
*   Provides a wealth of information about the structure and composition of molecules.  
  
**Limitations:**  
  
*   Water strongly absorbs IR radiation, so samples must be dry.  
*   Symmetrical molecules do not show IR spectra.  
*   Can be difficult to interpret complex spectra.  
*   Quantitative analysis can be challenging.  
  
**Related Techniques:**  
  
*   Raman Spectroscopy: Provides complementary information to IR spectroscopy by measuring the scattering of light by molecules. Raman spectroscopy is more sensitive to non-polar bonds.  
*   UV-Vis Spectroscopy: Measures the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light by molecules, providing information about electronic transitions.
