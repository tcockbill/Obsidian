# Types of Alcohol  
Primary alcohols -> only one alkyl group associated - 2 hydrogens on the C-OH carbon - OH at the end of a chain  
```smiles  
CCO  
```  
Secondary alcohols -> 2 alkyl groups - 1 hydrogen on the C-OH carbon - OH at middle of a chain  
```smiles  
CC(O)C  
```  
Tertiary alcohols -> 3 alkyl groups - no hydrogens on the C-OH carbon - OH at the junction of 2 chains  
```smiles  
CC(O)(C)C  
```  
  
# Physical properties of alchohols  
Physical properties depend on inter-molecular [[../../To do/Forces|forces]]  
  
Alcohol molecules attract each other via hydrogen bond inter-molecular [[../../To do/Forces|forces]].  
  
# Boiling points of Alcohols  
Alcohols have higher boiling points than similar sized [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] (London imf) or [[./Haloalkanes|haloalkanes]] (dipole-dipole imf) because of the stronger hydrogen bonding between molecules.  
  
-> Alcohols are less volatile than [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] and [[./Haloalkanes|haloalkanes]] of similar $M_r$.  
  
# Miscibility of Alcohols with water  
Molecules of similar size are miscible is they have similar imf  
  
Alcohols and water both have hydrogen bonds between molecules   
-> Alcohols and water are miscible, whereas [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] and [[./Haloalkanes|haloalkanes]] are immiscible with water  
  
As alcohol molecules get larger, the miscibility with water decreases as teh hydrocarbon chain becomes more significant and the O-H group becomes less significant

3. The boiling point of the alcohols increase as the length of chain increases as there are greater [[../Definitions/London forces|london forces]] holding the molecules to each other, requiring more energy to break  
4. There are more hydrogen bonds in the triol molecule, so there is more attraction via hydrogen bonds between the propan-1,2,3-triol and water  
  
# Reactions of alcohols  
  
## Oxidation  
Only primary and secondary alcohols can be oxidised  
  
Primary alcohols:  
$R-OH + [O] \overset{distillation}{\longrightarrow} \text{aldehyde} + H_2O$  
$R-OH + [O] \overset{reflux}{\longrightarrow} \text{carboxylic acid} + H_2O$  
  
Secondary  
$R-OH + [O] \overset{reflux}{\longrightarrow} \text{ketone} + H_2O$  
## Dehydration  
An alkene is formed when a dehydration reaction occurs  
  
$R-OH + acid \overset{heat}{\longrightarrow} alkene + H_2O$  
## Haloalkanes  
## Alkenes
