# Boiling points of [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]]  
1.  
The [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbon]] with the formula C$_6$H$_{14}$ is hexane  
Hexane is saturated  
$C_6H_{14}+19O_2$->$6CO_2+7H_2O$  
```smiles  
CCCCCC  
CCC(C)CC  
CCCC(C)C  
CC(C)C(C)C  
CC(C)(C)CC  
```  
The amount of impurities in the fuel would overcome the absorbing ability of a catylitic converter in a standard car or the engine cannot completely combust the fuel  
  
2. The crude oil undergoes fractional distillation. This is where the oil is heated until it is a gas, then the gases rise upwards and condense at differentlevels depending on their boiling points. These different components of crude oil are called fractions. Petrol is made from [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]] $C_5H_{12}, C_6H_{14}, C_7H_{16}, C_8H_{18}\space{or}\space{C}_9H_{20}$. These then have any preservatives or additives added before use.  
  
There are many more fractions of crude oil that can be used for diesel than petrol, so since we are running out of crude oil, petrol is becoming scarcer and there is more supply of diesel  
  
Methylbutane - its branched structure will help to prevent knocking and make the petrol less likely to ignite when we don't want it to. It is also a short chain alkane, making it even less likely to ignite spontaneously  
  
3. Naptha is a mixture of [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] having between 5 and 12 carbon atoms. These [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] can be seperated by fractional distillation. Short chained [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] need to be added to the petrol, so it would be the [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]] that condense first in the fractional distillation process that will need to be added to petrol  
4. Carbon Monoxide is produced in incomplete combustion as $C_5H_{12}+\frac{11}{2}O_2$ -> $5CO+6H_2O$  
  
Sulphur impurities in petrol create $SO_2$ when combusted, which can cause acid rain  
$S+O_2$->$SO_2$  
$SO_2+H_2O+\frac{1}{2}O_2$->$H_2SO_4$  
  
Nitrogen from air oxidised in hot engines forms $NO_2$, which can cause acid rain  
$N_2+O_2$->$2NO$  
$2NO+O_2$->$2NO_2$  
$2NO_2+H_2O+\frac{1}{2}O_2$->$2HNO_3$  
  
Modern cars are fitted with catalytic converters. They convert $NO_x$->$N_2, CO$->$CO_2$ using a platinum catalyst. While $CO_2$ still contributes to the greenhouse effect, it is better than toxic carbon monoxide.  
  
5. Initiation  
		$Cl_2$->$Cl\textbullet+Cl\textbullet$  
	Propogation:  
		$C_6H_{14}+Cl\bullet$->$C_6H_{13}\textbullet+HCl$  
		$C_6H_{13}\bullet+Cl_2$->$C_6H_{13}Cl+Cl\bullet$  
		$C_6H_{14}+Cl_2$->$C_6H_{13}Cl+HCl$  
	Termination:  
		$C_6H_{13}\textbullet+C_6H_{13}\textbullet$->$C_{12}H_{26}$  
		$Cl\bullet+Cl\bullet$->$Cl_2$  
		$C_6H_{13}\bullet+Cl\bullet$->$C_6H_{13}Cl$  
	$C_6H_{13}Cl$ will form, as well as chydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid if aqueous) which could be harmful to humans.
