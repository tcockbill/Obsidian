# Nomenclature  
Aliphatic - carbon atoms are joined to each other in unbranched (straight) or branched chains.  
Alicyclic - carbon atoms are joined to each other in ring (cyclic) structures:   
Aromatic - some or all of the carbon atoms are found in a [[./Benzene|benzene]] ring  
  
[[../Definitions/Alkanes|Alkanes]] - containing single carbon-to-carbon bonds   
[[../../To do/Alkenes|Alkenes]] - containing at least one double carbon-to-carbon bond   
Alkynes - containing at least one triple carbon-to-carbon bond   
  
To name a compound, you first count the number of carbons in the longest chain using this table:  
  
| Number of carbon atoms | Stem  | Parent alkane | Alkyl Group |  
| ---------------------- | ----- | :------------ | :---------- |  
| 1                      | Meth- | Methane       | Methyl      |  
| 2                      | Eth-  | Ethane        | Ethyl       |  
| 3                      | Prop- | Propane       | Propyl      |  
| 4                      | But-  | Butane        | Butyl       |  
| 5                      | Pent- | Pentane       | Pentyl      |  
| 6                      | Hex-  | Hexane        | Hexyl       |  
| 7                      | Hept- | Heptane       | Heptyl      |  
| 8                      | Oct-  | Octane        | Octyl       |  
| 9                      | Non-  | Nonane        | Nonyl       |  
| 10                     | Dec-  | Decane        | Decyl       |  
Then we identify and name the functional group by using this table:  
  
| Type of compound | Functional Group | Prefix                 | Suffix        |  
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- |  
| Alchohol         | OH               | Hydroxy-               | -ol           |  
| Alkane           | C-C              |                        | -ane          |  
| Alkene           | C=C              |                        | -ene          |  
| Alkyne           | C$\equiv$C       |                        | -yne          |  
| Carboxylic acid  | COOH             |                        | -oic acid     |  
| Haloalkane       | -Cl -Br -I       | Chloro-  Bromo-  Iodo- |               |

| Ketone           | -C(CO)C-         |                        | -one          |  
| Ester            | -COOC-           |                        | -oate         |  
| Acyl Chloride    | -COCl            |                        | -oyl Chloride |  
| Amine            | -NH$_2$          | amino-                 | -amine        |  
| Nitrile          | -CN              |                        | -nitrile      |  
When naming cyclic molecules, the prefix 'Cyclo-' is used to denote that it is cyclic
