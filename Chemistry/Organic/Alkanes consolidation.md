# Consolidation of [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]]  
## Properties of [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]]  
[[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]] are saturated [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]], containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms joined together by single [[../../To do/Covalent bonds|covalent bonds]].  
  
4. The bonding in ethane is [[../../To do/Covalent bonds|covalent]], which is a shared pair of electrons. The bond angle of the H -- C -- H bond is 90$\textdegree$ as the shape of the molecule is octahedral  
  
1. $2C_{12}H_{26}+37O_2$->$24CO_2+26H_2O\qquad{2C}_{12}H_{26}+25O_2$->$24CO+26H_2O$  
2. [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]] have strong C-C and C-H bonds, which have very high bond dissociation energies, which means they require a lot of energy to break. [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]] are also non-polar molecules, which makes them less reactive towards polar reagents. Most common lab reagents don't have the necessary strength or polarity to initiate a reaction with [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]]  
3. $C_6H_{14}+13O_2$->$12CO+14H_2O$  
4. $C_3H_8+Br_2$->$C_3H_7Br+HBr$  
5. Mechanism  
	Initiation:  
		$Cl_2$->$2Cl\textbullet$  
	Propogation:  
		$C_2H_6+Cl\textbullet$->$\textbullet{C}_2H_5+HCl$  
		$\textbullet{C}_2H_5+Cl_2$->$C_2H_5Cl+Cl\bullet$
