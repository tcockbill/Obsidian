# Reactions of [[../../To do/Alkenes|Alkenes]]  
1. [[../../To do/Alkenes|Alkenes]] are Unsaturated (C=C)  
	-> Addition reactions to form saturated (C-C) compounds  
2. C=C is a region of high [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] [[../../Physics/Density|density]]  
	-> Reactions with [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] deficient particles = electrophiles (e.g. $H^+, Br^+$)  
1 and 2 are electrophilic addition reactions are typical for [[../../To do/Alkenes|alkenes]]
