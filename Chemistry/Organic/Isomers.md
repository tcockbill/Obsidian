# Structural isomers  
Structural isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula, but a different structure of atoms:  
e.g. the 5 structural isomers of C$_4$H$_4$Cl$_2$  
  
```smiles  
C(Cl)(Cl)=C(C)  
  
C(C)(Cl)=C(Cl)  
  
C(C(Cl))=C(Cl)  
  
C(C(Cl)(Cl))=C  
  
C(Cl)(C(Cl))=C  
  
```  
# Functional Group isomers  
Functional group isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula, but the diffence is where the functional group is located.  
e.g. Two functional group isomers of hexanol  
```smiles  
CCCC(O)CC  
CCC(O)CCC  
```  
  
# Extended Structural isomers  
C$_3$H$_6$O could represent the aldehyde or ketone  
```smiles  
CC=O  
CC(=O)C  
```  
```smiles  
CC(C)=cccc(C)(O)C=C  
```  
Linalool or 3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-dien-3-ol
