## Benzene: Aromatic Hydrocarbon  
  
**Formula:** C₆H₆  
**Structure:**  
```smiles  
c1ccccc1  
```  
  
*   A cyclic (ring) structure of six carbon atoms.  
*   Each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen atom.  
*   Features alternating single and double bonds within the ring. However, this representation is not entirely accurate.  
*   The double bonds are delocalized, meaning the electrons are spread evenly around the ring. This delocalization is key to benzene's stability.  
  
**Key Properties:**  
  
*   **Aromaticity:**  Benzene is the archetypal aromatic compound.  Aromaticity provides exceptional stability due to the delocalized pi electrons following Hückel's rule (4n+2 pi electrons, where n is an integer).  
*   **Reactivity:** Less reactive than expected for an unsaturated hydrocarbon.  Undergoes substitution reactions more readily than addition reactions.  
*   **Resonance:** The delocalization of electrons is represented by resonance structures.  
*   **Physical Appearance:** Colorless, flammable liquid with a sweet odor.  
*   **Toxicity:** Benzene is a known carcinogen. Exposure can lead to leukemia and other blood disorders.  
  
**Reactions:**  
  
*   **Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS):**  The most common type of reaction.  An electrophile replaces a hydrogen atom on the ring. Common EAS reactions include:  
    *   **Halogenation:** Addition of a halogen (e.g., Cl₂ or Br₂) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., FeCl₃ or FeBr₃).  
    *   **Nitration:**  Addition of a nitro group (-NO₂) using a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids.  
    *   **Sulfonation:** Addition of a sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) using fuming sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄ with SO₃).  
    *   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Addition of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and a Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl₃).  Limitations include polyalkylation and rearrangement of alkyl groups.  
    *   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Addition of an acyl group using an acyl halide and a Lewis acid catalyst.  
  
**Uses:**  
  
*   Historically used as a solvent, but now largely replaced due to its toxicity.  
*   Important intermediate in the production of many chemicals, including:  
    *   Ethylbenzene (for styrene production)  
    *   Cumene (for phenol and acetone production)  
    *   Cyclohexane (for nylon production)  
  
**Resonance Structures:**  
  
*   Kekulé structures depict alternating single and double bonds.  However, the actual structure is a hybrid of these, with equal bond lengths between all carbon atoms.  
  
**Orbital Picture:**  
  
*   Each carbon atom is sp² hybridized.  
*   The three sp² hybrid orbitals form sigma bonds with two adjacent carbon atoms and one hydrogen atom.  
*   The remaining unhybridized p-orbital on each carbon atom overlaps laterally with the p-orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms, forming a delocalized pi system above and below the plane of the ring.  
  
**Nomenclature:**  
  
*   Benzene derivatives are named by adding substituents as prefixes to "benzene."  
*   If multiple substituents are present, their positions are indicated by numbering the carbon atoms of the ring.  Lowest possible numbers are used.  
*   Common prefixes include ortho- (1,2-), meta- (1,3-), and para- (1,4-) for disubstituted benzenes.
