# Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS)  
  
**Overview:**  
  
Electrophilic aromatic substitution is a chemical reaction where an electrophile replaces a hydrogen atom on an aromatic ring. It's a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, crucial for synthesizing substituted aromatic compounds.  
  
**General Mechanism:**  
  
1.  **Electrophile Formation:** The electrophile (E+) is generated, often with the help of a catalyst.  This is the rate-determining step in many EAS reactions.  
  
2.  **Attack of the Electrophile:** The electrophile attacks the pi system of the aromatic ring, forming a *sigma complex* (also known as an *arenium ion* or *Wheland intermediate*). This intermediate is positively charged and disrupts the aromaticity.  
  
3.  **Proton Loss (Deprotonation):** A base (often the conjugate base of the acid used as a catalyst) removes a proton from the carbon that is bonded to the electrophile. This regenerates the aromaticity and forms the substituted aromatic product.  
  
**Key Considerations:**  
  
*   **Aromaticity:**  The driving force for EAS is the stability gained by re-establishing aromaticity after the electrophile attacks.  
*   **Regioselectivity (Directing Effects):**  Substituents already present on the aromatic ring influence where the incoming electrophile will attack. They are classified as either *ortho/para directors* or *meta directors*.  
  
    *   **Ortho/Para Directors:** Activate the ring and direct incoming groups to the ortho and para positions.  Examples include alkyl groups, halogens, -OH, -OR, -NH2, -NHR, -NR2. These groups often have lone pairs that can donate electron density to the ring, stabilizing the sigma complex at the ortho and para positions.  Exceptions exist with halogens which deactivate the ring, but still ortho/para directing due to resonance stabilization of the sigma complex.  
    *   **Meta Directors:** Deactivate the ring and direct incoming groups to the meta position. Examples include -NO2, -CN, -SO3H, -CHO, -COR, -COOH, -COOR, -NR3+. These groups withdraw electron density from the ring, destabilizing the sigma complex at the ortho and para positions (because these positions have increased positive charge in the intermediate).  
  
*   **Reactivity (Activating and Deactivating Groups):**  Substituents also affect the overall rate of the EAS reaction.  
  
    *   **Activating Groups:** Increase the electron density of the ring, making it more reactive towards electrophiles. Examples include alkyl groups, -OH, -OR, -NH2, -NHR, -NR2.  
    *   **Deactivating Groups:** Decrease the electron density of the ring, making it less reactive towards electrophiles. Examples include -NO2, -CN, -SO3H, -CHO, -COR, -COOH, -COOR, -NR3+, and halogens (though halogens are ortho/para directors).  
  
**Common EAS Reactions:**  
  
*   **Halogenation:**  Reaction with a halogen (Cl2, Br2) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., FeCl3, FeBr3).  
*   **Nitration:** Reaction with nitric acid (HNO3) in the presence of sulfuric acid (H2SO4).  
*   **Sulfonation:** Reaction with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or sulfur trioxide (SO3).  
*   **Friedel-Crafts Alkylation:** Reaction with an alkyl halide (R-X) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl3).  *Limitations: polyalkylation, carbocation rearrangements can occur, does not work on strongly deactivated rings.*  
*   **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Reaction with an acyl halide (RCO-X) or acid anhydride ((RCO)2O) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (e.g., AlCl3). *Acylation is preferred over alkylation because it does not undergo polyacylation or carbocation rearrangements.*  
  
**Examples (with simplified mechanisms - full mechanisms should be studied in detail):**  
  
*   **Nitration of [[./Benzene|Benzene]]:** [[./Benzene|Benzene]] + HNO3 (with H2SO4 catalyst) --> Nitrobenzene + H2O  
  
    *   H2SO4 protonates HNO3 to generate nitronium ion (NO2+), the electrophile.  
    *   NO2+ attacks the [[./Benzene|benzene]] ring.  
    *   HSO4- removes a proton from the arenium ion to regenerate [[./Benzene|benzene]] ring and form nitrobenzene.  
  
*   **Bromination of [[./Benzene|Benzene]]:** [[./Benzene|Benzene]] + Br2 (with FeBr3 catalyst) --> Bromobenzene + HBr  
  
    *   FeBr3 activates Br2, making it a stronger electrophile (Br+).  
    *   Br+ attacks the [[./Benzene|benzene]] ring.  
    *   FeBr4- removes a proton from the arenium ion to regenerate [[./Benzene|benzene]] ring and form bromobenzene.  
  
**Important Notes:**  
  
*   The relative rates of reaction depend on the substituents already present on the ring.  
*   Steric hindrance can also play a role in determining the position of substitution.  
*   For polysubstitution, the directing effects of *all* substituents must be considered.  If they conflict, the stronger activating group usually dictates the product distribution.
