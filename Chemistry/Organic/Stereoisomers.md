```smiles  
C([X])([H])=C([Y])([H])  
C([H])([X])=C([Y])([H])  
```  
They can have different arrangements of same groups about a C=C group  
  
These two are different because they are non rotationable  
  
```smiles  
C(Cl)([H])=C(Cl)([H])  
C([H])(Cl)=C(Cl)([H])  
```  
One on the left is trans-1,2-dichloroethene  
One on the right is cis-1,2-dichloroethene  
  
## The E-Z system  
1. The higher the atomic number of the first atom bonded to C of C=C, the higher priority  
e.g. H < C < N < O < Cl in priority  
2. If two groups have the same first atom, move to the next atom, away from the double bond until a difference is found  
e.g. $CH_3$ < $C_2H_5$ < $ClCH_2$ < $BrCH_2$ < $CH_3O$ in priority  
3. A cis orientation of the higher priority is designated as "Z"  
4. A trans orientation of the Higher priority is designated as "E"
