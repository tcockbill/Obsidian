# Questions  
>[!exam-question] Question 1  
>Alcohols can be converted into chloroalkanes by reaction with hydrochloric acid, HCl  
>2-chloro-2-methylpropane can be prepared by shaking together $4.7 cm^3 \space (3.7g)$ of 2-methylpropan-2-ol with $20 cm^3$ of concentrated HCl. After 10 minuted, two separate layers begin to form.  
>  
>a. The top layer will contain the organic product as that [[../../Physics/Density|Density]] is lower than water  
>  
>b. The organic layer was shaken with a dilute solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate, $NaHCO_3$. A gas was evolved.   
>Identify this gas  
>  
>c. Suggest the chemical that could have reacted with the $NaHCO_3$ to form the gas  
>  
>d. The resulting impure organic liquid was dried with anhydrous calcium chloride and then distilled. $2.22g$ of pure 2-chloro-2-methylpropane was produced  
>	i. At what temperature would you expect the pure organic product to distil?  
>	  
>	ii. Calculate the amount, in mol, of the 2-methylpropan-2-ol used in the experiment  
>	  
>	iii. calculate the amount, in mol, of pure 2-chloro-2-methylpropane that was produced  
>	  
>	iv. Calculate the percentage yield
