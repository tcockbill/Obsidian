# Haloalkanes  
  
## Naming  
- General Formula is $C_nH_{2n+1}X$ where X is the [[../Definitions/Halogens|halogen]]. This is often shortened to $R-X$ where $R$ is the rest of the organic molecule  
- The prefixes **flouro-**, **chloro-** and **iodo-** tell us which [[../Definitions/Halogens|halogen]] is present  
- **Numbers** are used if needed to show on which carbon the [[../Definitions/Halogens|halogen]] is bonded  
- We can use the prefixes **di-**, **tri-** and **tetra-** etc. to show how many atoms of each [[../Definitions/Halogens|halogen]] is present  
- When a compound contains different [[../Definitions/Halogens|halogen]], they are listed in alphabetical order, not in order of the number of the carbon atoms to which they  
 are bonded.  
  
## Solubility of haloalkanes  
1. The polar $C^{\beta +}-X^{\beta -}$ bonds are not polar enough to make the haloalkanes soluble in water.​  
  
2. The main intermolecular forces of attraction are dipole-dipole and [[../Definitions/London forces|london forces]].​  
  
3. Haloalkanes mix with [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]], so they can be used as dry-cleaning fluids and to remove stains.  (Oil is a mixture of [[../Definitions/Hydrocarbons|hydrocarbons]]).  
  
## Boiling points of haloalkanes  
The longer the chain length, the higher the surface contact area, the stronger the [[../Definitions/London forces|london forces]], so the higher the boiling point.  
The boiling points of haloalkanes is higher than the boiling point of [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]], as the permanent dipole intermolecular [[../../To do/Forces|forces]] will be stronger due to the increased difference in electronegativity.  
  
## The reactivity of the C-X bond  
As the electronegativity of the [[../Definitions/Halogens|halogen]] decreases down the group, the attraction between the carbon atom and the [[../Definitions/Halogens|halogen]] atom will decrease as there is a greater difference in electronegativity or [[../../To do/Charge|charge]]  
  
The [[../Definitions/Halogens|halogens]] are more electronegative than carbon, so the bond polarity will be Cβ+-X β-​  
  
This means that the carbon bonded to the halogen has a partial positive [[../../To do/Charge|charge]]; it is [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] deficient.​  
  
This means it can be attacked by reagents which are [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] rich or have [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] rich areas. * ​  
  
The polarity of the C-X bond would predict that the C-F bond would be the most reactive.​  
  
*Note These are called nucleophiles. A nucleophile is an [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] pair donor.

a. When a nucleophile replaces an atom or group on an organic molecule.  
b. $C_3H_7Br+OH^-\rightarrow C_3H_8O+Br$  
d. The rate would increase as iodine is less electronegative than bromine, so requires less energy to remove it from the molecule.  
  
## Haloalkanes (Alkyl Halides)  
  
**Definition:** Haloalkanes, also known as alkyl halides, are organic compounds in which one or more hydrogen atoms in an alkane have been replaced by halogen atoms (Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, or Iodine).  
  
**General Formula:** R-X, where R is an alkyl group and X is a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, I).  
  
**Nomenclature:**  
  
*   **IUPAC Naming:**  Identify the parent alkane chain. Number the chain to give the halogen substituent the lowest possible number.  Prefix the halogen substituent with its number and the appropriate prefix (fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, iodo-). If multiple halogens are present, list them alphabetically.  
    *   *Example:* 2-Chlorobutane  
  
*   **Common Naming:**  Name the alkyl group followed by the halogen as a halide.  
    *   *Example:*  Isopropyl bromide  
  
**Classification:**  
  
*   **Based on the Carbon Atom Attached to the Halogen:**  
    *   **Primary (1°):** The halogen is attached to a carbon atom that is bonded to one other carbon atom.  
    *   **Secondary (2°):** The halogen is attached to a carbon atom that is bonded to two other carbon atoms.  
    *   **Tertiary (3°):** The halogen is attached to a carbon atom that is bonded to three other carbon atoms.  
  
**Physical Properties:**  
  
*   **Boiling Point:**  Boiling points generally increase with increasing molecular weight and with increasing atomic number of the halogen.  Branched haloalkanes tend to have lower boiling points than their straight-chain isomers.  Haloalkanes have higher boiling points than [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]] of comparable molecular weight due to dipole-dipole interactions (especially for chlorine and bromine).  
*   **Solubility:**  Haloalkanes are generally insoluble in water due to their inability to form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules.  They are soluble in many organic solvents.  
*   **Density:**  Haloalkanes are denser than [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]].  Polyhalogenated [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]] are generally denser than water.  
  
**Chemical Reactions:**  
  
Haloalkanes are versatile reactants and undergo a variety of important reactions:  
  
*   **Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions (SN1 and SN2):** The halogen atom is replaced by a nucleophile.  
    *   *SN1:* Unimolecular nucleophilic substitution. Favored by tertiary haloalkanes, polar protic solvents, and weak nucleophiles. Forms a carbocation intermediate.  
    *   *SN2:* Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution. Favored by primary haloalkanes, polar aprotic solvents, and strong nucleophiles. Proceeds with inversion of stereochemistry.  
*   **Elimination Reactions (E1 and E2):** A hydrogen atom and a halogen atom are removed from adjacent carbon atoms, forming an alkene.  
    *   *E1:* Unimolecular elimination. Favored by tertiary haloalkanes, polar protic solvents, and weak bases. Forms a carbocation intermediate. Follows Zaitsev's rule.  
    *   *E2:* Bimolecular elimination. Favored by primary haloalkanes, strong bases, and heat. Follows Zaitsev's rule.  Requires anti-periplanar geometry.  
*   **Grignard Reagent Formation:** Haloalkanes react with magnesium metal in anhydrous ether to form Grignard reagents (RMgX), which are powerful nucleophiles and bases.  
*   **Wurtz Reaction:**  Haloalkanes react with sodium metal to form [[../Definitions/Alkanes|alkanes]] with twice the number of carbon atoms. (R-X + 2Na + X-R  -> R-R + 2NaX)  
  
**Uses:**  
  
Haloalkanes have numerous applications, including:  
  
*   **Solvents:** Dichloromethane (methylene chloride), chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride are used as solvents.  
*   **Refrigerants:** Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were formerly widely used as refrigerants, but their use has been phased out due to their ozone-depleting properties.  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are now commonly used as replacements.  
*   **Anesthetics:** Halothane (a haloalkane) was formerly used as a general anesthetic.  
*   **Pesticides and Herbicides:** Some haloalkanes are used as pesticides and herbicides.  
*   **Polymer Synthesis:**  Vinyl chloride (chloroethene) is used in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).  
*   **Intermediates in Organic Synthesis:** Haloalkanes are important intermediates in the synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds.  
  
**Important Considerations:**  
  
*   **Toxicity:** Some haloalkanes are toxic and carcinogenic.  
*   **Environmental Concerns:**  Some haloalkanes, particularly CFCs, contribute to ozone depletion.  They are also potent greenhouse gases.  
*   **Reactivity:** The reactivity of haloalkanes depends on the halogen atom (I > Br > Cl > F) and the degree of substitution of the carbon atom attached to the halogen (3° > 2° > 1° in SN1/E1, 1° > 2° > 3° in SN2).
