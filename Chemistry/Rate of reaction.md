# Rates of reaction  
## Collision theory  
- Two reacting particles must collide for a reaction to occur  
- For an effective collision, particles must have:  
	- The correct orientation when colliding  
	- Enough energy to overcome the activation energy barrier to the reaction  
  
## Factors affecting the rate of reaction  
- Surface area  
- Temperature  
- Catalyst  
- Concentration/pressure  
	- <i>More particles in a given volume, more frequent effective collisions, faster rate of reaction</i>  
  
## Rate of reaction  
>[!formula] Formula for rates of reaction  
>The change in concentration of a reactant or product in a given time $$\text{rate} = \frac{\text{change in concentration}}{\text{time}}$$  
  
## Measuring rate of reaction  
If a gas is produced:  
- Measure the volume of gas produced  
	- Using either a measuring cylinder or a gas syringe, taking recordings at regular intervals  
- Measure the loss of mass  
	- Record the mass of the flask and contents at regular intervals  
  
If a solid produced:  
- Time a change in colour or turbidity  
	- Time how long it takes a cross to disappear underneath the flask  
  
## Calculating rate from a graph  
<b>Steeper=faster</b>  
<b>Flat=Reaction finished, limiting reactant has run out</b>  
Rate is fastest at the start â€” highest conc. of reactants  
Slows down as reactants are used up.  
  
1. Plot the results collected from the experiments  
2. Draw a tangent on the graph at the time of interest  
	- <i>If looking for the initial rate, t=0</i>  
3. $\Delta y/\Delta x$ to calculate rate

# Rate determining step  
## Reaction mechanisms  
Many reactions take place in multiple steps as it is unlikely that all particles will collide at the same time  
this series of steps is the reaction mechanism  
  
## Rate-determining step (RDS)  
- the slowest step in a reaction  
- the RDS determines the overall rate of the reaction  
  
Things to know:  
- All the species in the RDS are in the rate equation  
	- If not in the rate equation, it is in a different (faster) step  
- The orders in the rate equation match the number of that species in the RDS  
	- If a reactant is second order, there will be 2 lots of it in the RDS  
- The subsequent steps must generate all the products in the overall balanced equation  
	- This does not include intermediates as these are both formed and used up again, meaning they cancel out  
  
# Question  
The RDS of a reaction between X and Y is:  
2X --> Z  
Predict the rate equation for this reaction.  
  
$\text{Rate } = k[X]^2$  
  
## Summary questions  
1. It is unlikely that all the reactants collide succesefully at the same time, so the reaction will be made of multiple steps  
2.   
	1. $\text{Rate }=k[H_2O_2][Br^-]$  
	2. $2H_2O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O + O_2$  
	3. $BrO^-$  
	4. Catalyst

1. $8.66 \times 10^{-3}$  
2. 2  
3. The rate is doubled

order of $O_3$ = 1 -> determined from the rate and concentration that $\frac{3\times10^{-3}}{1 \times 10^{-3}} = 3$ and $\frac{3.2 \times 10^{-8}}{9.6 \times 10^{-8}} = 3$  
order of $NO_2$ = 1 -> determined from the rate and concentration that $\frac{2.5 \times 10^{-3}}{5 \times 10^{-3}} = 2$ and $\frac{9.6 \times 10^{-8}}{1.92 \times 10^{-7}} = 2$  
Overall order = 2  
rate equation = $k[O_3][NO_2]$  
$3.2 \times 10^{-8} = k \times 1 \times 10^{-3} \times 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$  
$0.0128=k$  
$\text{rate } = 0.0128[O_3][NO_2]$  
  
It needs to be two step as the stoicheometry of the overall equation and the rate equation do not match as there needs to be one mole of each molecule in the rate reaction, but there are two moles of $NO_2$ in the overall equation  
$O_3+NO_2 \rightarrow 2O_2 +NO$  
$O_2+NO_2+NO \rightarrow N_2O_5$

fifth order  
  
![[../Extra Files/Pasted image 20250606140027.png|Pasted image 20250606140027]]  
- It is unlikely that all the reactants will collide with each other with sufficient energy and in the right orientation all at the same time  
- The stoichemitry of the rate equation does not match the stoicheometry for the rate-determining step, as in the overall equation, the iodide ions have a coefficent of 5, but in the rate equation, they need a coefficient of 2  
  
  
![[../Extra Files/Pasted image 20250606140412.png|Pasted image 20250606140412]]  
It is the step that takes the longest time to complete, and therefore determines the rate of the reaction

$OH^-+I^- \rightarrow IOH$

$\frac{0.16}{0.08} = \frac{0.0120}{0.0060}$ therefore the $S_2O_3^{2-}$ is first order  
$\frac{0.012}{8} = 0.0015$ therefore $H^+$ is zero order as it does not affect the rate of the reaction  
therefore the students results support the rate equation
