Successive ionisation energies increase with ionisation number because their is increased nuclear [[../../To do/Charge|charge]] per [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]], plus less shielding, which increases the ionisation energy.  
  
The sudden large increases in ionisation energy shown in **Table 16.1** shows us that there is a sudden drop in [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] shielding, which suggests that there are shells present at different distances away from the nucleus.

Group 2 as the ionisation energy rapidly increases after 2 ionisations

Similarity: Both have 3 carbons bonded to another carbon  
Difference: No IMFA in graphine

I would not excpect diamond to be a good conductor of electricity as it does not have delcocalised electrons that can freely flow and carry [[../../To do/Charge|charge]]

a. Structure - giant lattice, bonding - metallic  
b. I would excpect gallium to not be souble in water as the gallium is non-polar and the water is polar  
c. $Ga_2O_3$

It is the amount of energy required to remove one [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] from a mole of gaseous atoms to create a mole of gaseous positive ions

The [[./First ionisation energy|First ionisation energy]] will decrease down the group as their is more [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] shielding and the nuclear attraction decreases, so their is less force resisting losing electrons

The gap between the 6th and 7th ionisation energies will be larger than the other gaps.
