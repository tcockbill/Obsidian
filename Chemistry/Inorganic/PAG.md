# PAG for [[./Qualitative analysis|Qualitative analysis]]  
1. Label the unknown solutions A-E.  
2. For each solution, use a dropping pipette to transfer 1-2 drops of each solution onto a different piece of indicator paper each time.  
3. Compare each piece of indicator paper with the included colour chart.  
4. Record the pH values for each solution and compare to the following table.  
  
| Solution         | pH          |  
| ---------------- | ----------- |  
| Nitric acid      | < 7         |  
| Potassium iodide | $\approx$ 7 |  
| Sodium carbonate | > 7         |  
| Sodium chloride  | $\approx$ 7 |  
| Silver nitrate   | $\approx$ 7 |  
5. Note the letter of the acidic compound and put it to the side.  
6. Use a measuring cylinder to measure and add 3ml of each of the four solution to four different test tubes and label the test tubes with the letter of the solution.  
7. Add 1ml of the identified acidic solution to each test tube using a dropping pipette and record any observations.   
8. If the solution bubbles, it confirms the presence of [[../../To do/Carbonate ions|carbonate ions]] in the solution.  
9. Put the test tube of carbonate solution to the side.  
10. Add 1ml of carbonate solution into the 3 remaining test tubes using a differnt dropping pipette to step 7 and note the observations.   
11. If a white [[../../To do/Precipitate|precipitate]] forms, Silver nitrate is present.  
12. Put the test tube of silver nitrate to the side.  
13. Add 2ml of the silver nitrate to each of the the 2 remaining solutions using a different dropping pipette to steps 7 and 10 and note the observations.  
14. If white precipitate is formed, Chloride ions are present, and if yellow precipitate is formed, Iodide ions are present
