# Question 3  
A. if you increase the pressure, the rate will increase as there will be a greater number of particles in a given volume, so there will be more collisions overall, therefore there will be more collisions with sufficient energy to create a sucesseful collision  
  
B. A reversible reaction will work to counter any change made to the system  
  
C. i. When you increase the pressure, the system works to decrease the pressure again by shifting the [[../../Equilibrium|equilibrium]] to favor the reaction that creates the least number of molecules, which, in this case, is the reaction that produces methanol  
When you decrease the temperature, the system works to counter the reaction by shifting the [[../../Equilibrium|equilibrium]] to favour the exothermic reaction, as this will increase the temperature. In this case, the exothermic reaction is the one that produces methanol, therefore increasing the [[../../Equilibrium|equilibrium]] yield of methanol.  
  
ii. The actual conditions may be a lower pressure and a higher temperature, as it costs a lot of money to keep a system at a high pressure and low temperature, and a very high pressure may even be dangerous.
