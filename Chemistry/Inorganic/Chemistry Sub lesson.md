# Exam questions for [[./First ionisation energy|Trends in reactivity]]  
1.   
	1.   
		1. The random motion of the electrons in an atom or molecule can cause the [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] spread to be uneavenly distributed, which creates a temporary dipole, where one part of the molecule has a slight negative [[../../To do/Charge|charge]], and another part has a slight positive [[../../To do/Charge|charge]]. This temporary dipole can induce a similar dipole in a neighboring molecule. The positive pole of one molecule and the negative pole of the other molecule attract and cause a London bond between the two molecules
