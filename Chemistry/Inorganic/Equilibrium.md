## Definition  
- When, in a closed system, the forward reaction and the reverse reaction are happening at the same rate, where the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant  
  
A closed system requires:  
- No substances added/taken away  
- No external conditions, such as temperature and pressure, to be changed  
  
## Position of equilibrium  
The position of equilibrium indicates the extent of the reaction, and can be moved left or right.  
<b>Le Chatelier's principle</b>: The position of equilibrium shifts to cancel out any changes made to the system.  
  
The position of equilibrium is influenced by:  
- Temperature  
- Concentration  
- Pressure (in reactions involving gases)  
  
## Effect of concentration  
If concentration is increased, equilibrium will shift to decrease it again — shifts in whichever direction uses up the substance  
If concentration is decreased, equilibrium will shift to increase it again — shifts in whichever direction forms the substance  
  
## Effect of temperature  
If temperature is increased, equilibrium will shift to decrease it again — shifts in the direction of the endothermic reaction  
If temperature is decreased, equilibrium will shift to increase it again — shifts in the direction of the exothermic reaction  
  
## Effect of pressure  
If pressure is increased, equilibrium will shift to decrease it again — shifts in the direction with the least moles of gas  
If pressure is decreased, equilibrium will shift to increase it again — shifts in the direction with the most moles of gas  
  
## Effect of adding a catalyst  
Catalysts have no effect on the position of equilibrium as it speeds up the forward and reverse reactions equally. It does however mean a reversible reaction reaches equilibrium quicker.

You want a low temperature as it favors the forward reaction because the froward reaction is exothermic, so it will release heat energy to equalise the ajustment.  
However, you want a high temperature as this increases the [[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]], however, that is expensive, so we comprimise for a middle temperature  
You want low pressure, as that favors the reaction with the least amount of moles, which is the forward reaction, however, to increase the [[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]], you want high pressure as there is more molecules im a set volume, so this increases collisions, and therefore sucesseful collisions, that increases the [[../Rate of reaction|rate of reaction]]. However, it is dangerous to keep it at a consistent high pressure, slo we comprimise for a slightly lower pressure, while still maintaining a low enough pressure to favor the forward reaction.

## Equilibrium constant Kc  
  
In general:  
$aA+bB \rightleftharpoons cC+dD$  
Where:  
$$Kc=\frac{[D]^d[C]^c}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$  
  
### Homogeneous vs heterogeneous  
**Homogeneous** - All species are in the same state  
- All species are included in the $K_c$ expression  
  
**Heterogeneous** - Species are in different states or phases  
- Only (g) and (aq) are included in the expression for $K_c$  
	- The concentration of solids and pure liquids are assumed to remain constant, meaning that they are not considered  
  
$\text{e.g.,} \quad P_4 (s) + 5O_2(g) \rightleftharpoons P_4O_{10} \text{ gives } K_c = [O_2]^5$  
  
>[!note] ### Calculating $K_c$  
You need to be able to calculate $K_c$ when given the following data:  
>- <u>Concentrations</u> of species at equilibrium  
>- Moles of species at equilibrium  
 -Involves an extra step to calculate concentration  
>- <u>Moles</u> of species at the start/at equilibrium from experimental result  
>- Requires determining amounts from experimental results and the balanced equation

## Equilibrium constant Kp  
### Mole fractions  
**Mole fraction (x)** - The proportion of a given gas present in a mixture  
$$\text{Mole fraction } (x) = \frac{\text{Number of moles of A}}{\text{Total number of moles}}$$  
  
### Partial pressure  
**Partial Pressure (p)** - The contribution of a gas to the total pressure (P)  
$$\text{Partial pressure (p) } = \text{ Mole fraction (x) } \times \text{Total pressure (P)}$$  
Sum of partial pressures = Total pressure  
Values may be given in Pa, kPa or atm - any is fine as long as the units are all consistent  
  
>[!note] ### Kp  
>  
Equilibria involving gases are typically expressed in $K_p$, as apposed to $K_c$, as it is easier to measure pressure of gas vs concentration  
>  
Where:  
$aA+bB \rightleftharpoons cC+dD$  
$$K_p = \frac{p(C)^c \thinspace p(D)^d}{p(A)^a \thinspace p(B)^b}$$  
Only include gases in this equation

## Position of equilibrium  
  
IN BOOK  
  
The value of **K** <u>must remain constant</u>, meaning that conditions will be altered to <u>restore <b>K</b></u> once changes in concentration/pressure are made to the system  
  
This is the reason behind Le Chatelier's principle - the position of equilibrium shifts to restore K and keep it constant  
  
TASK IN BOOK  
  
Catatlysts change neither the position of equilibrium or the value of K  
  
  
| Condtition changed | Does the value of K change | Does the equilibrium shift |  
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |  
| Temperature        | Yes                        | Yes                        |  
| Pressure           | No                         | Yes                        |  
| Concentration      | No                         | Yes                        |  
| Catalyst           | No                         | No                         |
