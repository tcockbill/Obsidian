# Exam Practice for [[./Trends in Bonding and Structure|Trends in Bonding and Structure]] and [[./Periodicity|Periodicity]]  
  
2. The bonding and structure in C is giant metallic, and the bonding and structure of D is giant ionic  
3. *Si* has the most delocalised electrons, so has the strongest metallic bonds. Across [[../../To do/Period|period]] 3, the elements then go to non-metal, which forms [[../../To do/Covalent bonds|covalent bonds]], and therefore London bonds, which are much weaker than metallic bonds. However, the exception to this is carbon, which forms a giant covalent structure of either graphite/graphene or diamond. Because of the sheer amaount of [[../../To do/Covalent bonds|covalent bonds]], yo will need a lot of energy to break all the lattice, so it has a super high melting point.  
5. [[../../To do/Period|Period]] 5, p-block  
6. Giant covalent structure  
9. Silicon has the highest melting point  
8. Because magnesuim has more delocalised electrons that can form electrostatic attraction between themselves and the cations, the metallic bonds are stronger, and therefore require more energy to break. Therefore, the melting point of magnesium is much higher than the melting point  
12. The order of the elements of the [[../Definitions/Periodic Table|periodic table]] is determined by number of protons in the nucleus  
13. Their outer [[../../Physics/Electron|electron]] is in the p sub-shell  
11. The melting point of the metal chlorides is much higher than the non-metal chlorides
