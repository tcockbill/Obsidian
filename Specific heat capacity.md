# Specific heat capacity  
The specific heat capacity of a substance is the energy needed to raise the temperature of 1kg of the substance by 1$\degree$C  
It changes depending on the substance due to the internal energy store absorbed in addition to the kinetic energy store absorbed  
>[!Formula]  
>$E=mc \Delta \theta$  
>  
>## Units  
>$Jkg^{-1}K^{-1}$  
  
If you input the same heat energy, the substance with the large heat capacity has a small temperature increase, but the substance with the smaller heat capacity will have  a greater temperature increase.
